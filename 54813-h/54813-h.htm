<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PERFECT CHAPERON</span></h2>
<p>Three girls, Azalea McBirney, Annie Laurie Pace and Carin
Carson rode slowly along the red clay road that led
no-where-in-particular.&nbsp; In fact, these friends were bound
for No-Where-In-Particular, and the way there was lined on both
sides with blossoming dogwood, as white as snow.&nbsp; There were
snow-white clouds in the sky, too, against a background of
glorious blue.&nbsp; But the balm in the air suggested anything
rather than snow.&nbsp; It blew back and forth, carrying with it
delicious perfumes of the blossoming shrubs that grew by the
roadside and within the wood, and touching the cheek like a
caress.</p>
<p>The horses seemed to be enjoying themselves almost as much as
the girls.&nbsp; They stepped daintily, throwing back their heads
as if they <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>would be pleased if their mistresses would give them
leave to be off and away down the road, and expanding their
nostrils to catch the scents of the spring-awakened earth.&nbsp;
But their mistresses were too deeply engaged in conversation just
then to grant them their desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the fairest of them was
saying&mdash;the one the others called Carin&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t really <i>want</i> to go to Europe with father and
mother this time.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t as if they were going to
stay in one place.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be traveling the whole
time, because, you see, father is going on business, and mother
is going along to keep him company.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be
very pleasant, would it, to hear mother saying: &lsquo;And now
what in the world will we do with Carin to-day?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Really, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t at all enjoy having my name
changed to &lsquo;Little-Carin-in-the-Way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tallest girl, Annie Laurie Pace, laughed rather
enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of giving up a European trip for that!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, I&rsquo;ll be only too thankful to go on
some other occasion, Annie Laurie, when there&rsquo;s time to see
things or to study.&nbsp; Remember, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>I&rsquo;ve gone twice already; once
over the same ground that father and mother are going over this
time.&nbsp; The next time, I hope to stay and study, but this
summer I want to follow the plan we made last summer and go up
into the mountains and teach school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you really, Carin?&rdquo; cried Azalea, the
third girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered and wondered if
you&rsquo;d remember about that!&nbsp; Would your father and
mother let you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen.&nbsp; One can always
ask.&nbsp; Do you think Ma McBirney would give you permission,
Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think she would.&nbsp; The trouble with Ma
McBirney is that she&rsquo;s likely to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
whether my going makes it hard for her or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t she plan,&rdquo; broke in Annie
Laurie, &ldquo;to visit her cousin down Calhoun way?&nbsp; Pa
McBirney will be going too, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he could leave the stock and the
farm.&nbsp; But you see, I thought maybe Mother McBirney would
want to take me along to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To show off her new daughter,&rdquo; laughed
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant anything of the sort,&rdquo; protested <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Azalea,
coloring.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of course, having picked me up by the
roadside the way she did&mdash;like a poor stray kitten, you may
say&mdash;perhaps she would like her relatives to see that I
wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Azalea hesitated again, with the
mocking eyes of her friends on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you weren&rsquo;t <i>what</i>?&rdquo; demanded
Carin teasingly.</p>
<p>But Annie Laurie interrupted with one of the practical remarks
for which she was celebrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you girls to talk of going
off to the mountains to teach school,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
have you any idea of where you&rsquo;ll go and whom you&rsquo;ll
teach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a very clear idea,&rdquo; answered Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to Sunset Gap, where we were last
summer, and where they need help about as badly as they
can.&nbsp; I was talking with Azalea&rsquo;s minister, Mr.
Summers, and he says he doesn&rsquo;t know of any place where the
people are in greater need of schooling than they are
there.&nbsp; You remember the place, Annie Laurie, don&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; We stopped there overnight when we were on our camping
trip.&nbsp; It took us a long time to get there by wagon, but
this time we&rsquo;ll take the train as far as Bee Tree and drive
only <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the
last fifteen miles.&nbsp; Mr. Summers says he knows a man who
will meet us at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve quite made up your mind to go,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
girl you are, to be laying out all these plans without telling
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t done much,&rdquo; protested Carin,
&ldquo;only, when I happened to meet Mr. Summers, I talked it
over with him.&nbsp; You see, there are men and women up there on
Dundee mountain who don&rsquo;t even know their letters, and
teaching the children will be like carrying civilization to
them,&rdquo; said Carin earnestly, meaning very much more than
she said but trusting her sympathetic friends to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very kind of work that I want to do
above everything else,&rdquo; declared Azalea with an earnestness
no less than that of her friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Annie Laurie,
if we go, do come with us!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d make the best
teacher of us all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re so firm, and you always
think out beforehand what you&rsquo;re going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way for me to live up to that fine
reputation,&rdquo; retorted Annie Laurie, &ldquo;is by staying at
home.&nbsp; This is my last chance for learning to manage my
dairy, for Sam Disbrow, who <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>has been taking almost all of the
responsibility, is leaving me next October for his two years at
Rutherford Academy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so happy to think he&rsquo;s
going, after all the disappointments and troubles he&rsquo;s
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t your Aunt Adnah look after the dairy
for a couple of months?&nbsp; I thought she was a fine business
woman,&rdquo; Carin persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carin, father&rsquo;s death was a much greater
shock to her than to any of the rest of us.&nbsp; She
oughtn&rsquo;t to have much care.&nbsp; Anyway, the dairy is my
business now that father is gone, and I&rsquo;m anxious to learn
every detail of it.&nbsp; I understand now about keeping the
books, but I am making a study of raising fodder and preserving
it, and of feeding the cattle and marketing the milk.&nbsp; Oh,
it&rsquo;s a huge undertaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is,&rdquo; sighed Carin
sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer, when you come
to think of it, that work had to be brought into the world?&nbsp;
Why weren&rsquo;t we made like the birds, so that we could hop
around awhile, and sing awhile, and go to sleep under a nice dry
leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Well, life isn&rsquo;t that way,&rdquo; said
Annie Laurie in the solemn tones the Paces sometimes used.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have to work for what we get, and I&rsquo;m glad we
do.&nbsp; Life is more interesting just the way it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to keep busy myself,&rdquo; admitted Carin,
&ldquo;but if anyone came up to me and told me that what I was
doing was <i>work</i>, I believe I&rsquo;d fall in my
tracks.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave a silvery laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you&rsquo;ve taught school a week, you&rsquo;ll
not need anyone to point out that what you are doing is
work,&rdquo; Annie Laurie returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Azalea, have you
spoken yet to Pa and Ma McBirney about going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea gave a little chuckle, half of amusement, half of
affection, as her friend spoke the names of the good mountain
people who had taken Azalea into their home when she was
orphaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;because until this hour I didn&rsquo;t know Carin was
really planning for it.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll have to approach
the subject cautiously.&nbsp; You know how it is with my dear
pretend-parents; they&rsquo;re mountain people and don&rsquo;t
like to be frightened out of <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>their wits by having a question
hurled at them.&nbsp; You have to lead them up to it, like you
would a nervous horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;like you would,&rsquo;
Azalea,&rdquo; pleaded Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know Miss
Parkhurst never lets you.&nbsp; Say &lsquo;as you would,&rsquo;
Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you would,&rdquo; breathed Azalea meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
grand plan and I hope it will come true, though I&rsquo;m not
perfectly in love with the idea of having you girls go off for
the summer and leave me.&nbsp; But never mind that.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s have a gallop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flicked the reins on the neck of her pretty mare, and the
animal, delighted at the signal, bounded away as playfully as a
kitten.&nbsp; Like kittens, too, the ponies on which the other
girls were mounted followed after.&nbsp; As they rode, the blooms
of the dogwood rained about them and the laughter of the girls
mingled with the nickering of the horses.</p>
<p>At the ford, two miles down the valley, they drew rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I was getting home,&rdquo; said Annie
Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;How about you, Azalea?&nbsp; Do you go up
the mountain to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m staying with Carin.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
getting <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to
be my habit on Friday nights.&nbsp; Mother McBirney comes down
Saturday for her trading, and I meet her at the village and then
we go home together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now while they canter back down the lovely Valley of Lee
in the bland light of the closing day, let us tell something of
their history to such readers as have not met them before.</p>
<p>Azalea McBirney did not bear the name to which she was
born.&nbsp; She was Azalea Knox, the daughter of a
ne&rsquo;er-do-well son of a fine family, and of a loving-hearted
mother who had left her home and friends for the sake of the man
she married.&nbsp; The young mother had fallen upon such evil
days that at last, to provide her little girl with the
necessaries of life, she had traveled with a band of sorry actors
who journeyed from town to town in squalid, covered wagons.&nbsp;
Sick in body and shamed in spirit, she died on the road in front
of the mountain cabin where Thomas and Mary McBirney lived.&nbsp;
They had taken Azalea into their home, where she shared their
care and affection with Jim McBirney, their only living
child.</p>
<p>Carin Carson was the daughter of Charles and Lucy Carson,
Northerners of wealth, who, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>having lost their three sons in a
tragic manner, had come to the beautiful little mountain town of
Lee, to forget, if possible, amid its beautiful surroundings and
peaceful life, the pain which had made their old home impossible
to them.&nbsp; They had interested themselves greatly in Azalea,
had offered to make her their adopted daughter, and upon her
decision to stay with her devoted foster mother, had given her
the privilege of sharing with Carin the excellent instruction
received from Miss Parkhurst, Carin&rsquo;s governess.</p>
<p>A warm friendship had developed between the girls, and it was
a sharp disappointment to them when Mrs. Carson, who thought they
were growing too self-centered and indifferent to other young
folk, brought into their classroom Annie Laurie Pace, the
daughter of the dairy-man at Lee.&nbsp; It was only after Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s revolt from their selfishness that they realized
the need they had of her as well as the privilege that it was to
her&mdash;a girl too advanced for the district school&mdash;to
share their opportunities with them.&nbsp; Troubles came to Annie
Laurie.&nbsp; She lost her father and her fortune; but these
misfortunes only bound the three girls closer in <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>&ldquo;the
triple alliance&rdquo; which they had formed.&nbsp; When, finally
Annie Laurie&rsquo;s fortune was recovered by a singular chance,
they settled down into happy enjoyment of their school days.</p>
<p>The previous summer had found them together with their elders
upon a camping trip which was to remain in the minds of all of
them as one of the most delightful experiences of their
lives.&nbsp; On this excursion they had seen something of the
lives of the mountaineers of the Blue Ridge far back from the
railroads and the main routes of travel, and had resolved that at
the first opportunity they would return to pass on to these
untaught, friendly, wistful folk some of the knowledge which had
been bountifully given them.&nbsp; But this thought had slipped
out of sight during the winter, for each girl had been much
occupied after her own fashion.&nbsp; Now, with the return of
summer, their thoughts turned naturally to the mountains.&nbsp;
Back of their desire to be useful to their less fortunate
neighbors, was the hunger for life in the open.&nbsp; They
dreamed of the low-lying valleys bathed in purple mist, of the
flaming azalea burning on the higher slopes, of the innumerable
flowers springing to life along the adventurous <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>pathways, of
the wild beauty of the storms, and the ever-new miracle of
sunrise and sunset.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie said good-bye, and Carin and Azalea turned in at
the great gate of the Shoals, the beautiful home built by Colonel
Atherton, the grandfather of Azalea.&nbsp; But Azalea entered it
now, a poor girl, the foster daughter of simple mountain folk,
and it was Carin&rsquo;s parents who owned the fine old place and
who lived there in a very different sort of state from that which
had obtained in Colonel Atherton&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; His thought
had been all of his own indulgence and glory.&nbsp; Charles
Carson and his wife had their greatest happiness in sharing their
prosperity with others.&nbsp; They had built up a trade for the
handicraft of the mountain people, had lent a hand to several of
the enterprises in the town of Lee, and were the chief supporters
of a school for the mountain children.</p>
<p>When Mustard and Paprika, the ponies, had been led away by the
stable boy, the girls ran up the wide sweeping stairs to
Carin&rsquo;s room to dress for dinner, and as they brushed their
hair and changed their frocks, they talked of how they could best
approach their parents <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>with their rather madcap plan of
going up into the mountains.&nbsp; In the midst of their talk
Mrs. Carson came into the room.&nbsp; She kissed them in her
gentle way and then held Azalea off with one white jewelled hand,
eyeing her with quizzical affection.&nbsp; Azalea returned her
look adoringly, for Carin&rsquo;s mother was the girl&rsquo;s
ideal of what a &ldquo;beautiful lady&rdquo; should be.&nbsp; The
faint breath of violet perfume which floated from her gowns, the
satin sheen of her waving hair, her indescribably soft and
musical voice, her gestures, her laugh, all served Azalea as the
standard by which she measured charm in women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two have been plotting something,&rdquo; declared
the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can read conspiracy in your
faces&mdash;such a pair of telltale faces as you have!&nbsp;
Come!&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew Azalea closer to her, and the girl nestled her face
for a moment against Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s soft cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mountains, mamma Carson,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Carin and I want to go up there and teach
school the way we planned last summer.&nbsp; You remember,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s not a very
dark <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>conspiracy.&nbsp; There wouldn&rsquo;t be any objection
if we weren&rsquo;t going abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s because you are going abroad,
mamma,&rdquo; cried Carin, &ldquo;and because I don&rsquo;t
really want to go, that this plan seems so&mdash;so
timely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, that was where the argument began.&nbsp; It was
continued at the dinner table; it was taken up the next day with
the McBirneys as soon as ever they showed their faces in the
village, so that they were not, after all, allowed to approach
the subject in that gradual and cautious manner advised by
Azalea; it was carried to the Reverend Absalom Summers and his
wife Barbara.&nbsp; Even Jonathan Summers, aged three, took a
hand in it by pulling Azalea&rsquo;s skirt and saying:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carson explained the situation to Mr. Summers after this
fashion: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I am really so keen about
taking Carin on this trip; and I certainly have no objection to
her making herself useful, but going to live upon a wild mountain
among wilder people doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me as the best thing
for young girls to do.&nbsp; I doubt if it would be
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe?&rdquo; roared the Reverend Absalom, who <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>had been a
mountain man himself and to whom the honor of the mountaineers
was dear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Safe, Mr. Carson!&nbsp; Do you mean to
insinuate that those girls wouldn&rsquo;t be as safe on Dundee
Mountain as here in the town of Lee?&nbsp; Are you not aware that
women are honored and protected in the remotest regions of our
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carson enjoyed the outbreaks of his friend and was not at
all put out at having provoked one.&nbsp; His smile led Mr.
Summers to suppose that his eloquence had not been vigorous
enough, so he resumed in a louder tone of voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may do a good many things up on the mountain that
aren&rsquo;t generally approved of by people living in the
valleys; we may quarrel among ourselves, and we may forget to pay
the government the tax on our whiskey; we may be lazy&mdash;we
<i>are</i> lazy, if you like; we may have different ideas of
enjoyment from those you have, but if you think there is any
human panther among us who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carson roared with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Summers,&rdquo; he cried, waving his hands to stop
the stream of protest, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think anything.&nbsp; But you know yourself that if
the girls go up to Sunset Gap, <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>they&rsquo;ve got to have a reliable,
sensible, agreeable woman along with them.&nbsp; Now where shall
we find anyone like that?&nbsp; She must like roughing it, yet
she&rsquo;ll have to be a refined, companionable woman.&nbsp; She
must know how to keep the pantry stocked, do the cooking, and yet
be a restraint to our impulsive young people.&nbsp; Such a person
is hard to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Summers had to admit that it was.&nbsp; His little wife,
Barbara, who wanted terribly to go with the girls but who was
unwilling to leave her preacher-man, had to admit it also, though
she usually was the first to think of the answer to any
puzzle.&nbsp; Finally, Mr. Carson put it this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;McBirney and his wife are willing Azalea should go,
providing the proper protectress is found.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson and
I feel the same way.&nbsp; Now, Summers, I ask you, isn&rsquo;t
it up to the girls to find the right chaperon?&nbsp; Why not
leave it in their hands?&nbsp; Let them produce a woman of good
sense, refinement, courage, love of adventure mixed with
judgment, well-educated, accustomed to killing snakes, friendly
to the mountain people, with a religious nature and a perfect
disposition&mdash;no objection to a little knowledge <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>of medicine
thrown in&mdash;and they can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Absalom threw back his head and laughed, and his
laugh was entirely out of proportion to the size of the little
house in which he and his wife and his yellow-headed son lived
and had their being, and in which they were now entertaining
their friends the Carsons and the McBirneys.</p>
<p>But Carin and Azalea arose to the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an hour before father and mother are to
start up the mountain for home,&rdquo; said Azalea, taking the
dare gayly; &ldquo;so we&rsquo;ve time to go out and look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
great at finding four-leaf clovers.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I
find the perfect chaperon?&rdquo;&nbsp; Half in expectation, half
in despair, the two of them ran off down the sunny street,
followed by the applause of Barbara Summers&rsquo; small brown
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Carin, when they were beyond the
hearing of their elders, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go tell Annie
Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even if
she doesn&rsquo;t know of the right person, she must be told what
we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not far from the Summers&rsquo; home to the <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>rather gaunt
house which Annie Laurie Pace had inherited.&nbsp; The girls made
their way between the well-kept fields in which the fodder was
raised for Annie Laurie&rsquo;s fine herd of cattle&mdash;the
celebrated Pace herd, which provided milk for half the
county&mdash;and so came by carefully tended roads to their
friend&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie had been training vines to grow over the austere
house, and had made flower gardens in the yard which until
recently had worn a forbidding and business-like
appearance.&nbsp; There was even an arbor about which clematis
and wisteria were beginning to climb, and here, sparsely
sheltered by shade, sat Miss Zillah Pace, the younger and gentler
of Annie Laurie&rsquo;s two aunts.&nbsp; There was a wistful look
on her face and her hands lay idly in her lap, but when she saw
the two girls she got to her feet and came swiftly forward to
meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how very nice to see you
on such a beautiful day!&nbsp; Everyone ought to be young to-day,
oughtn&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; I declare, I don&rsquo;t see how
I&rsquo;m ever going to give up and be middle-aged if it means
sitting around here at home season in and season out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you such a very giddy girl, Miss <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Zillah?&rdquo; asked Carin in amusement, casting an eye
at Miss Zillah&rsquo;s staid frock and prim little curls, and
thinking how amusing it was that such a settled little person
should be able to think of herself as adventurous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on the outside,&rdquo; returned Miss Zillah.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I was young I had a very great sense of duty, and
there were many opportunities for me to exercise it.&nbsp; But do
you know, I&rsquo;m kind of worn out doing my duty, and I&rsquo;d
give anything if I were going away on some such jaunt as we went
on last year.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked at the girls appealingly,
and then concluded with a shy little smile, &ldquo;I suppose you
think I&rsquo;m a dreadfully silly old woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Carin had clasped Azalea&rsquo;s arm in a fierce
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The perfect chaperon,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;made
to order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found in fifteen minutes,&rdquo; whispered back
Azalea.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah, who caught their rapid exchange of confidence,
looked perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think us rude, Miss Zillah,&rdquo;
pleaded Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not; we&rsquo;re merely
excited.&nbsp; You see, we&rsquo;ve just made a
discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Have you, my dears?&rdquo; asked Miss
Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come sit down in the arbor and tell me about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re almost too elated to sit
down,&rdquo; laughed Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, what we have
discovered, Miss Zillah, is you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a long time since you landed on my
continent,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but when we first saw you we made the same mistake
that Columbus did.&nbsp; We thought you were some one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you think I was?&nbsp; Who am I?&rdquo; laughed
the nice old lady, glad of an excuse to be talking happy
nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we thought you were just Annie Laurie&rsquo;s
aunt,&rdquo; explained Azalea, &ldquo;but now we&rsquo;re
wondering if you&rsquo;re not our chaperon.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
going up to Sunset Gap again; this time to teach school.&nbsp;
And we <i>must</i> have a perfect chaperon, else we&rsquo;ll not
be allowed to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re she!&rdquo; cried Carin, flinging her
arms impulsively about Miss Zillah&rsquo;s soft neck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know you are!&nbsp; Say you&rsquo;ll come, Miss
Zillah, and then we can run back and tell our people that
everything is all right.&rdquo;</p>

29</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PASSENGERS FOR BEE TREE</span></h2>
<p>Three weeks later there was a notable gathering at the
railroad station at Lee.&nbsp; The Carsons were there, the Paces,
the McBirneys, including Jim, in a new straw hat, Dick Heller,
just up from the Rutherford Academy, Sam Disbrow, happy now and
full of wholesome activity, Hi Kitchell and his sister, and ever
so many others, some black and some white.&nbsp; The baggage man
was oppressed with a sense of the importance of the luggage he
was to put on the train, for it included, as he realized full
well, the summer outfit of Miss Zillah Pace and her
charges.&nbsp; That is, if Azalea and Carin, so important and
full of business, so suddenly grown up as it seemed, and their
own mistresses, could possibly be looked upon as
&ldquo;charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wire Mr. Summers if anything goes wrong, Carin,&rdquo;
Mr. Carson was commanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you write me everything&mdash;simply
everything,&rdquo; warned Annie Laurie.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;You will find it very profitable to keep a diary,
Sister Zillah,&rdquo; Miss Adnah Pace commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a burning shame we&rsquo;re not all
going,&rdquo; little Mrs. Summers sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure the mountain air is just what Jonathan needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan, who was toddling from friend to friend, sociably
offering the words: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go&rdquo; as an example of
his conversational powers, really did not seem to need much of
anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you all went,&rdquo; broke in the Reverend Absalom
Summers, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d have just as much of a town up at the
Gap as we have down here in the valley, and then that would spoil
it all, and we&rsquo;d have to light out again.&nbsp; Queer,
isn&rsquo;t it, how we all swarm to a town and then hike out to
the solitude, and fret wherever we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s the train,&rdquo; cried Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, mother McBirney, dear, I&rsquo;ve got to go.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re sure you won&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty late in the day to be thinking about
that,&rdquo; said Ma McBirney with laughing tremulousness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You take care yo&rsquo;self, Zalie, and look after Miss
Zillah and Miss Carson, and yo&rsquo;r pa and me&rsquo;ll be all
right.&nbsp; Do yo&rsquo;r level best to pass on the
l&rsquo;arnin&rsquo; to them pore <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>untaught folks, Zalie.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll be honin&rsquo; for you, but we&rsquo;re mighty proud
that yo&rsquo;re able to be a help to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea blushed violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;the people
will hear you and they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m a regular
missionary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake hands, girl,&rdquo; cried Pa McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were off.&nbsp; Miss Zillah had a seat to herself and
her bags and boxes.&nbsp; Carin and Azalea sat together, and for
a time said very little.&nbsp; Both were a bit
tearful&mdash;Carin particularly, at the thought that her parents
were going over-seas.&nbsp; But after a while they grew
interested in the flowering mountain side and the little cabins
tucked away on the shelves of the mountains.&nbsp; Azalea even
caught a glimpse of the McBirney cabin lying so confidently on
its high ledge&mdash;the cabin through whose hospitable door she
had entered to find the only home she knew.</p>
<p>To keep the tears from getting out beyond her lids, where they
were swimming at rising flood, she turned her attention to the
people with her in the car.&nbsp; Opposite was an old woman in a
sun <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>bonnet, chewing her snuff stick and staring straight
before her, without, apparently, the slightest curiosity about
anyone.&nbsp; In front of her sat a little girl of seven, who
evidently was traveling quite alone.&nbsp; She was just the sort
of a child Azalea liked&mdash;though, come to think of it, Azalea
had never seen any sort of a child she did not like.&nbsp; This
one, however, was especially attractive, no doubt about
that.&nbsp; She had purplish-blue eyes, like pansies, and dark
hair and lashes so long they swept her cheeks.&nbsp; She looked
both shy and innocently bold, both plain and pretty, both
graceful and awkward, both wistful and mischievous.&nbsp; Azalea
decided that when she grew up she probably would be lovely.</p>
<p>She kept glancing at the girls as if she would like to be
acquainted with them, and finally Azalea motioned for her to come
over to their seat.&nbsp; The little girl got up at the first
crook of Azalea&rsquo;s finger and crossed the aisle, smiling and
coloring as she came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like sitting all alone very well, do
you?&rdquo; Azalea asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s horrid
traveling in the cars with no one to talk to.&nbsp; <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Don&rsquo;t
you think I&rsquo;m lucky to have my friend with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the little girl in a very
sweet voice.&nbsp; Then after a pause: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
bring any of my friends with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to think she would have been the one to do the
&ldquo;bringing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It evidently did not occur to her
that she would have been &ldquo;brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn over this seat if you like,&rdquo; said
Azalea, &ldquo;and then you may sit with us.&nbsp; Mayn&rsquo;t
she, Carin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp; She got up to
turn over the seat, but it stuck and rocked and acted in a
singularly perverse way, as car seats sometimes will, and at that
a lad who had been sitting with his nose buried in a book, arose
and came quickly to her assistance.</p>
<p>He was so slender and graceful, his dark eyes were so friendly
and quick to make responses, that the girls and Miss Zillah could
not help staring at him for a few seconds with surprise and
admiration in their eyes.&nbsp; In America lads and young men
often have a way of looking like grown men before their
time.&nbsp; They are too <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>business-like, too responsible, too
seasoned.&nbsp; But this boy was as eager, as gentle as the girls
themselves.&nbsp; He not only had not grown up&mdash;though he
was as tall as the majority of men&mdash;but he looked as if he
had no intention of doing so for some time to come.&nbsp; He held
his cap in his hand, and showed a beautifully shaped head
overgrown by a short crop of dark curls which he had, apparently,
tried in vain to straighten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seat,&rdquo; he said with a sudden smile, showing
two rows of teeth that could be described in no other way save as
&ldquo;gleaming,&rdquo; &ldquo;has a bad disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sorry to have troubled you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for me to
shake the cussedness out of anything that acts like that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave the seat such a shake as irritable parents give to
naughty children, and got it over in place somehow, and he
settled the little girl in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything that you&rsquo;d like to have brought
over here, Miss Rowantree?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; said the little girl, &ldquo;my dolly
and my package.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>She
spoke with a fine distinctness and with a charming accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s English, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; whispered
Carin to Azalea.</p>
<p>The doll, a battered but evidently well-loved affair, was
brought, and a box held in a shawl strap, which no doubt
contained the small person&rsquo;s wearing apparel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you know her name was Miss
Rowantree?&rdquo; Azalea asked, or started to ask.&nbsp; Before
she had finished her question she saw on the child&rsquo;s dark
blue reefer a piece of cloth, neatly sewn in place, and with
these words on it in indelible ink:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance Rowantree.&nbsp; Please see that she leaves
the train at Rowantree Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re terrible young to be traveling alone,
child,&rdquo; said Aunt Zillah seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;How ever
could they let you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got so homesick they had to,&rdquo; explained the
child with equal gravity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody could come with me,
so I had to come alone.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she
added valiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you reach your home before dark,&rdquo; went on
Aunt Zillah, quite at ease now that she had somebody to worry
about.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the child answered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get home a long time before sundown, and my
father will meet me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke in such a slow and
particular fashion that she made them all smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right then,&rdquo; said Azalea
cheerfully, who was afraid the little girl was having some fears
manufactured for her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, please tell me the name
of your doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mary Cecily Rowantree, after my
mamma,&rdquo; said the little girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
a pretty name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty as a song,&rdquo; said the youth, who was still
standing by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it was my name,&rdquo; the little girl
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only named Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a lovely name,&rdquo; Carin told
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;It means that you will always have to be true
to those you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love ever so many people,&rdquo; said the
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to keep right on loving
them as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They chatted on for a while, as congenial folk will on the
train.&nbsp; No doubt if Azalea had been left to herself she
would frankly have told her new acquaintances just where she and
her friends <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>were going and what they intended to do, but the more
reserved Carin and the cautious Miss Zillah forbade, by their
eyes, any such confidences.&nbsp; So, after Constance had
finished telling how a lady named Miss Todd has come to live with
them for a while, and how she had taken
her&mdash;Constance&mdash;home with her, and how Constance had
stayed till the &ldquo;spell&rdquo; of homesickness conquered
her, no more confidences were made save by the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This country&rsquo;s new to me,&rdquo; he told
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about it, so I came
up to see what it was like.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;m a
painter.&nbsp; At least if I keep on working for the next twenty
years maybe I&rsquo;ll become one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
sketching on the islands off the Carolina coast, and now
I&rsquo;m going to see what I can do with the mountains.&nbsp; I
painted some pictures of the sea that were so bad the tide
didn&rsquo;t come in for three days and maybe I can make the
mountains so enraged that they&rsquo;ll skip like lambs.&nbsp;
Anyway, it will be fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you get off?&rdquo; asked Azalea
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanged if I know,&rdquo; the youth replied, turning on
them again the radiance of his beautiful <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Any place that looks wild enough will get me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wild at Rowantree Road,&rdquo; said the
little Constance gravely, looking up from under her long lashes
with almost the expression of some woods creature.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We never see anybody hardly.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t think
how wild it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time went on and in spite of Miss Zillah&rsquo;s reserved
manner, all of the young people were beginning to enjoy
themselves and each other when the train came to a sudden
stop.&nbsp; It was so sudden that it threw Constance forward on
Carin&rsquo;s lap and hurled the contents of the overhead
carry-alls down on the heads of the travelers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Constance, righting herself, &ldquo;I
hope Mary Cecily isn&rsquo;t broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Miss Zillah anxiously,
addressing herself to the only man in the party.</p>
<p>But the young man was already out of the car, making
investigations, and he was followed by four traveling men who
plunged out of the smoking room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go see&mdash;&rdquo; began
Azalea.&nbsp; But Miss Zillah&rsquo;s hand was on her arm.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;Sit still, my dear.&nbsp; The gentlemen will look
to the matter,&rdquo; she said with the confidence of the
old-time woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they will,&rdquo; protested Azalea,
half-vexed and half-laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have all
the fun of seeing to it.&nbsp; I want some of the fun
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt the engine has broken down,&rdquo; said Carin
calmly, &ldquo;and you couldn&rsquo;t do anything about that,
could you, Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance wriggled out of her seat and started for the door,
but Miss Zillah caught and held her gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are much better in here, my dear,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>The child, rebuked, turned her attention to picking up the
articles that had fallen from their racks.&nbsp; There were, in
the seat where their new acquaintance had been sitting, a
knapsack and an artist&rsquo;s kit, marked K. O&rsquo;C. in large
black letters on the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K stands for Kitty,&rdquo; said Miss Constance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O stands for Oliver.&nbsp; C stands for
Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man came rushing back into the car, and he
overheard.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;K stands for Keefe,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;and O&rsquo;C for O&rsquo;Connor.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
myself, such as I am.&nbsp; The engine has broken
down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; murmured Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re likely to be tied up here for
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a single track, I think,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah
with forced calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are we not in danger of a
collision?&nbsp; Would you advise me, sir, to take the young
ladies out into the open air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Keefe O&rsquo;Connor, packing
articles back in the racks and generally settling the car.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We may as well break up the time a little.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
happened to look at Constance and caught a look of dismay on the
face that until now had been so cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Rowantree, what is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we stay here for hours,&rdquo; said the wise little
girl, &ldquo;it will be jet dark when I get to my
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her lips quivered a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come dark, come light,&rdquo; said the young man,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be all right, Constance Rowantree.&nbsp; Just
you trust to me.&nbsp; Anyway, worry never yet mended
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But plenty of worrying was done on that train <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>first and
last that afternoon.&nbsp; The engineer worried and the conductor
worried, the brake-men had their own troubles, and the passengers
fretted as hard as they could.&nbsp; Carin and Azalea walked up
and down the track with Miss Zillah and Constance, and tried to
think they liked the adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Summers said that Mr. McEvoy would meet us no
matter what happened,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah, &ldquo;and I take
it that what Mr. Summers says is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Azalea assured
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll certainly be met, Miss
Zillah.&nbsp; But even if we shouldn&rsquo;t be, there&rsquo;d be
some place for us to stay.&nbsp; There are houses at Bee Tree,
aren&rsquo;t there?&nbsp; Or do you think there is only a
tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are houses,&rdquo; put in Constance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Daddy goes there to get his letters and the
groceries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get off at Bee Tree with us?&rdquo;
asked Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we can look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Daddy wrote
that I was to get off at Rowantree Road.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s ever so
much nearer our house.&nbsp; I must do just what papa said.&nbsp;
If he was there waiting for me <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and I stayed on the train, he&rsquo;d
feel dread-ful-ly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a very long word of &ldquo;dreadfully,&rdquo;
separating the syllables in her queer way.</p>
<p>The conductor of the train overheard what was being said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, Miss Constance,&rdquo; he said:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see your father standing right there
before me ready to take you in charge before I&rsquo;ll let you
off in those woods alone.&nbsp; It will be plumb night before we
get to your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, conductor,&rdquo; said one of the
traveling men, &ldquo;let one of us boys get off with the little
girl.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t do at all for her to be dropped in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw lots to see who does it,&rdquo; proposed another
of the traveling men, and began tearing up pieces of paper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here, you fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Keefe O&rsquo;Connor objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You men
are on business, and it throws you out of your whole week&rsquo;s
schedule if you miss a town.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m out gunning for
scenery.&nbsp; Want to paint it, you understand.&nbsp; I have no
destination&mdash;only a mileage ticket.&nbsp; Let me get off
with the little girl.&nbsp; If her father is on hand, I can swing
back <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>on
the train again.&nbsp; If he isn&rsquo;t, she can guide me to her
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terribly long way,&rdquo; said Constance
dolefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right through the woods.&nbsp;
You haven&rsquo;t a lantern with you, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Keefe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
lantern, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d make our way.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you promise me you wouldn&rsquo;t worry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the child seriously, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There really was only one person on the train who could be
said to refrain, and that was the mountain woman with the snuff
stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-studying nigh on three months about
going to see my son Jake,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and now it
don&rsquo;t seem to matter much when I do git thar.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got shet of the work to home for a spell,
anyhow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve kep&rsquo; at it twelve year without a
let-up, and setting by a while won&rsquo;t trouble me
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had anything to eat, for all had counted on reaching
their destination by supper time, so that sundown saw a group of
hungry people with only Miss Zillah Pace&rsquo;s generous supply
of cookies to comfort them.&nbsp; But at last <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the engine
was repaired in such a way that the engineer &ldquo;reckoned it
would hold,&rdquo; and the train moved cautiously on through the
darkness, delayed here and there at sidings, and throwing trains
all along the line out of their time schedule.</p>
<p>There was silence in the car.&nbsp; The traveling men no
longer told their stories; Aunt Zillah nodded but dared not doze
for fear of missing her station; the mountain woman brooded
patiently, caring little, it seemed, as to what fate might have
in store for her; and little Constance slept in Azalea&rsquo;s
arms.&nbsp; Carin was supremely patient and quiet; and the bright
eyes of Keefe O&rsquo;Connor gleamed now and then from under the
rim of his cap, which was pulled low over his face, and behind
which he was occupied in thinking his own thoughts.</p>
<p>But he was alert enough when the conductor came to warn him
that they were approaching Rowantree Road.&nbsp; He and Azalea
between them got the little girl awake, and with his packages and
hers, the friends saw him swing off the train in the black
murk.&nbsp; The conductor&rsquo;s lantern threw a little glow
around him where he <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>stood holding the hand of Constance fast in his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty good thing you&rsquo;re here, sir,&rdquo; they
heard the conductor say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I certainly would have been
put out if I&rsquo;d had to leave the little one in the dark by
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my daddy is somewhere,&rdquo; Constance reassured
him in her high ringing tones; and as they pulled out they heard
her voice calling &ldquo;Daddy!&nbsp; Daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light!&rdquo; cried Aunt Zillah
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s just up the track a
way.&nbsp; Her father must be there after all.&nbsp; Really,
it&rsquo;s the greatest relief to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traveling men seemed to be relieved, too.&nbsp; So was the
conductor; so, no doubt, were the brakemen.&nbsp; No one knows
what the engineer felt.&nbsp; He probably was praying that his
repairs would hold out.&nbsp; The mountain woman took out her
snuff stick again.&nbsp; Just then the conductor called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out for Bee Tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea caught at her parcels; Carin gathered up hers more
deliberately; Aunt Zillah arose in a flutter, dropping things
here and there which the conductor and the youngest of the
traveling <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>men picked up, and presently they were off in the mellow
gloom.&nbsp; But it was a gloom with a lantern-light to mitigate
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be you the ladies Mr. Summers writ about?&rdquo; a
cordial voice inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m McEvoy.&nbsp; Step
along this way, please.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SUNSET GAP</span></h2>
<p>The night was as bland as it was dark.&nbsp; Neither stars nor
moon lighted the way of the travelers, but Miles McEvoy&rsquo;s
horses had no need of these celestial bodies to help them keep
the road.&nbsp; They knew it, though it swept around Simms&rsquo;
barn and took the cut-off by Decker&rsquo;s hill, and plunged
straight through Ravenel&rsquo;s woods.&nbsp; They did not
tremble as, climbing and still climbing, it carried them along
the edge of a gorge; nor did they quake when their hoofs beat on
a resounding bridge, though there were but planks between them
and an abyss.</p>
<p>Dew-wet branches touched the faces of those who sat in the
sagging old wagon, and low-flying bats brushed their hair.&nbsp;
Owls hooted, hounds barked, and all the unnamed sad night noises
of the mountain reached their ears.&nbsp; Azalea had known such
journeys many and many a time in the old days when she had
traveled in the caravan with Sisson&rsquo;s actors, but to <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Carin and
Miss Zillah this plunging ahead up a strange road in the pitch
blackness was a new and not altogether pleasant experience.&nbsp;
Mr. McEvoy may have guessed at their feelings, for he said after
a long silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Summers was for you-all stopping down at Bee Tree
for the night.&nbsp; You could &lsquo;a&rsquo; put up at
Mis&rsquo; Casey&rsquo;s by turning her step-ma out&rsquo;n her
bed.&nbsp; But even then it would have took some studying, for
the three of you would have had to bunk together, and that looked
to me a leetle like crowding the mourners.&nbsp; So I said to
Mis&rsquo; McEvoy I&rsquo;d better haul you right up home and
settle you in our spare room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very good of you,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah
heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that you had to wait so
long for the train.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid Mrs. McEvoy will have
cooked supper for us hours ago, and that she&rsquo;ll be quite
discouraged by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said McEvoy
placidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been laying in stores for
you-all these two or three days past.&nbsp; All I&rsquo;m to do
is to whoop when we hit Rattlesnake Turn, and she&rsquo;ll put
the kettle to b&rsquo;iling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; asked Carin from somewhere down <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>in her
throat, &ldquo;is Rattlesnake Turn, Mr. McEvoy,
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but a crook in the
road, miss.&nbsp; A few rattlers has been kilt there on and off,
and the folks like to keep the name.&nbsp; It makes it sound kind
of exciting like, and there ain&rsquo;t so many things to cause
excitement hereabouts.&nbsp; We have to make the most of them
we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave a little chuckle, and Carin
drew a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said under her breath to Miss
Zillah, &ldquo;that I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of lions.&nbsp; At
least, not terribly afraid.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be willing to go
hunting wild beasts if I had a good rifle, but I certainly do
hate snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snakes?&rdquo; murmured Mr. McEvoy pensively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Snakes don&rsquo;t like to be rubbed the wrong way.&nbsp;
Nuther do folks.&nbsp; Take things easy, I say&mdash;snakes
included.&nbsp; Go your way and let them go their&rsquo;n.&nbsp;
Of course if they show fight, why, scotch &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I seem
to understand snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His musical drawling voice died away languidly, and no one
made any reply.&nbsp; But Azalea, who knew the mountain people,
smiled a little in the darkness, thinking to herself that Mr. <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>McEvoy&rsquo;s kind treated their neighbors much as he
did his snakes.</p>
<p>All things come to an end, and the mountain ride was no
exception to the rule.&nbsp; Tired, rather stiff and very hungry,
Miss Zillah and the two girls were helped out on a horse block
made of the huge bole of a chestnut tree, and were ushered by
&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Cassie McEvoy,&rdquo; into the brightness of
her mountain cabin.&nbsp; (She was given the benefit of her full
name by the neighbors to distinguish her from her sister-in-law
who lived &ldquo;over beyant.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Mrs. McEvoy had the table set, the fire blazing on the open
hearth, and the kettle simply leaping among the coals.</p>
<p>She was quiet and shy, but she wanted her visitors to feel at
home and she told them so in a voice even softer and slower than
her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She led them into the second room in
the cabin&mdash;there were only two&mdash;and here, sure enough,
was the &ldquo;company room,&rdquo; with its two beds heaped high
with feather ticks and covered with hand-woven
counterpanes.&nbsp; The walls were decorated with large framed
patent medicine advertisements, very strong in color, and quite
entertaining in subject.&nbsp; One showed <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>St. George
slaying the dragon, the legend below advertising some oil that
was warranted to cure man of almost all his pains and
aches.&nbsp; Another pictured a knight in coat of mail, mounted
on a charger, rushing at the fell castle of Disease, his lance in
rest.&nbsp; There were many others, and in a moment or two Azalea
discovered that these went with the rows of bottles&mdash;three
deep&mdash;upon the mantel shelf.&nbsp; Tall and dark, squat and
ruddy, all much labeled and sampled, they stood there to bear
witness to the chief interest of Mis&rsquo; Cassie McEvoy&rsquo;s
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t look sickly to me,&rdquo; said Miss
Zillah anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least no more so than the
mountain women usually do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mis&rsquo; McEvoy did not long leave Miss Zillah in
ignorance of her complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; she said while she busied
herself setting her supper before them, &ldquo;that I was trying
to p&rsquo;isen &rsquo;em, to look at them medicine bottles in
thar.&nbsp; I said to Miles it was a pity I didn&rsquo;t have no
other place to put &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I told her,&rdquo; broke in her husband,
&ldquo;that a chimney shelf was whar folks set out the most
costly stuff they had, and by that I reckoned <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>them medicine
bottles was whar they belonged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ailing,&rdquo; said Mis&rsquo; McEvoy,
looking straight past her husband at Miss Pace, &ldquo;for nigh
on fifteen years.&nbsp; Nobody,&rdquo; she said proudly,
&ldquo;can make out what it is that <i>does</i> ail me.&nbsp;
Some says it&rsquo;s this and some says it&rsquo;s that.&nbsp;
Some says take this and some says take that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she heeds &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said McEvoy, with a
sound in his throat between a laugh and a groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
if you&rsquo;ve got anything that&rsquo;s good for what ails her,
Miss Pace, ma&rsquo;am, if you&rsquo;d be so kind as to mention
the name of it I would get it the next time I&rsquo;m down to the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them pictures you see on the wall in the company
room,&rdquo; went on Mis&rsquo; McEvoy, &ldquo;come with the
medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do so,&rdquo; said her husband, passing the
chicken to Carin.</p>
<p>Carin and Azalea were just tired enough to feel silly.&nbsp;
Each girl knew if she but caught the eye of the other, she would
be off in a fit of laughter, and this was no time for them to
disgrace themselves when they had come up as bearers of learning
and manners, so to speak.&nbsp; So they looked anywhere except at
each other, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>and only Miss Zillah noticed that they were choking over
their food as they strangled their giggles.</p>
<p>As soon as politeness permitted, they excused themselves, and
it was a happy moment for them when they tumbled onto the high
feather bed and lay there in delicious drowsiness listening to
the call of the whippoorwills.&nbsp; They could hear Miss Zillah
softly moving around, and now and then through half-closed lids
they saw her conscientiously brushing her hair&mdash;counting the
strokes as she did so&mdash;reading her Bible and saying her
prayers.&nbsp; But at last preparations for the night were
finished and all sank to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why call this Sunset Gap?&rdquo; asked Carin the next
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t Sunrise Gap do as
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was streaming gorgeously through the open casement
full upon the bed where the girls lay.&nbsp; Azalea sat up with a
start, wondering for a moment where she was, and how it came that
Carin&rsquo;s voice was in her ears.&nbsp; Then she saw Miss
Zillah&rsquo;s curls upon the pillow of the adjoining bed,
recognized the triple row of bottles on the mantel shelf, and
remembered that she was now a responsible person.&nbsp; She <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>was a
teacher, a kind of missionary, a somebody with a purpose!&nbsp;
It was both amusing and alarming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carin,&rdquo; she said with a little nervous laugh,
&ldquo;why ever did we come?&nbsp; Do you suppose we can do
anything worth doing?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m frightened, honestly I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin sat up in bed too, and Azalea watched her hair turn into
shining gold where the sun played upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey-bird, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
Carin demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought people were always brave
in the morning and downhearted at night.&nbsp; You were braver
than I was last night coming up that dreadful road in the dark,
and now here you are, getting fussy in broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Azalea, a little ashamed,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve simply got to make a success, haven&rsquo;t
we?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as I ever before simply <i>had</i>
to make a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, the way Mr. McEvoy does the
snakes,&rdquo; laughed Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you get to feeling
so dreadfully wise and responsible you won&rsquo;t be able to do
a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah from her <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>bed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I myself have always been too anxious.&nbsp; It runs in
the Pace blood to be serious and care-taking.&nbsp; But now that
I&rsquo;m middle-aged and have taken time for thought I see that
owls have never been as much liked as larks.&nbsp; So you be a
lark, Azalea.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you naturally are,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea gave a little chuckle.&nbsp; She liked Miss
Zillah&rsquo;s way of putting things; moreover, these particular
words stuck in her memory.&nbsp; She contrived to &ldquo;be a
lark&rdquo; at breakfast, and she insisted on helping Mis&rsquo;
Cassie McEvoy with the dishes and on entering with vivacity into
the discussion of whether medicine that was good for rheumatism
would cure heartburn.&nbsp; Two bottles of patent medicine which
were enjoying the most favor just at that time, stood on a tiny
shelf above the kitchen table.&nbsp; One was very fat and
contained a dark liquid, and this Azalea secretly named
&ldquo;Bluebeard.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other was slender, tall and
filled with a pinkish stuff, and this she called &ldquo;The
Princess Madeline.&rdquo;&nbsp; She told Carin, and they amused
themselves by watching to see which was most in favor.&nbsp; As
nearly as they could make out, Mis&rsquo; Cassie favored
Bluebeard of mornings and so <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>probably turned to Princess Madeline
along toward night.</p>
<p>Mr. McEvoy had gone down to Bee Tree to get the three horses
which Mr. Carson was having sent up.&nbsp; Mustard and Paprika
were coming, with a gentle old nag which had been one of Miss
Zillah&rsquo;s best friends for many years and which bore the
name of Minerva.&nbsp; So, the house being tidied, the four women
folk started out&mdash;Mis&rsquo; Cassie acting as
guide&mdash;and went to look at the schoolhouse and the little
cabin where Miss Zillah was to set up housekeeping with the
girls.</p>
<p>The log schoolhouse, which had been unused for four years, lay
four-square to the compass, facing the purple south.&nbsp; Not
that the south had any advantage over the other points of the
compass in regard to its color.&nbsp; All the world, except, of
course, the immediate foreground, was purple up at Sunset
Gap.&nbsp; The mountains threw up peak after peak through the
purple dimness, and the sky itself lost something of its blue
brightness because of the purple veils which drifted between it
and the sweet-smelling earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time was,&rdquo; explained Mis&rsquo; Cassie,
&ldquo;when this here school was kep&rsquo; up fine.&nbsp; That
was <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>when
the Ravenels lived over to the Hall.&nbsp; Mr. Theodore Ravenel
was pore in his health and he come up this-away to git
well.&nbsp; He and his wife and his children lived to the
Hall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the Hall?&nbsp; Where is it, please?&rdquo;
asked Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over beyant,&rdquo; replied Mis&rsquo;
Cassie, waving her hand vaguely toward the slope before
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he died, and Mis&rsquo; Ravenel took the
childer&rsquo; and left.&nbsp; I reckon she would have given
something toward keeping up the school if she could have spared
the money, but she had four young ones to rear, and
couldn&rsquo;t see her way to it.&nbsp; The school and the
teacher&rsquo;s house is just as she left it.&nbsp; My old
man&rsquo;s kept an eye on things.&nbsp; He vowed he
wouldn&rsquo;t see the place tore to pieces.&nbsp; Thar was
plenty hereabouts who would &lsquo;a&rsquo; helped theirselves to
the furniture and fixings if he&rsquo;d let &rsquo;em, but he
said, no, anybody who had the gift of peering into the future
could see that sometime that school would be set up here
ag&rsquo;in.&nbsp; And what he said has come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried Azalea,
delighted as she always was at any sign of friendliness and
hopefulness in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>hurry, Mrs.
McEvoy, please; I&rsquo;m just wild to see how the schoolhouse
looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mis&rsquo; Cassie slipped the huge key in the door and the
four entered the musty schoolroom.&nbsp; It was, as mountain
schools go, a well-equipped room.&nbsp; There was a fireplace on
one side for comfort in mildly chill weather, and a large sheet
iron stove on the other for use on colder days.&nbsp; The
teacher&rsquo;s platform was backed by a blackboard; there were
good desks for both pupils and teacher, and comfortable seats
with backs to them.&nbsp; The room was well lighted, and no
dirtier than might be expected.&nbsp; It is needless to say,
however, that Miss Zillah&rsquo;s first thought was of the
cleaning it must undergo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can I find some one to do the cleaning for us,
Mrs. McEvoy?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must have
everything scrubbed and the walls whitewashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mis&rsquo; Cassie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
take pride in cleaning out, and Miles, he could
whitewash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you strong enough?&rdquo; asked Miss Zillah
kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Taking medicine all the time as you do,
I&rsquo;m afraid you oughtn&rsquo;t to do such hard
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Mis&rsquo; Cassie smiled so that she showed the vacant
places between her long pointed teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taking all that thar medicine that&rsquo;s
pearted me up so I <i>can</i> do it,&rdquo; she said
triumphantly.&nbsp; Miss Zillah said no more in the way of
warning, but straightway came to terms with Mis&rsquo;
Cassie.&nbsp; Azalea and Carin, looking from the windows, did not
really think this the best site in the world for a
schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it will be with the
pupils,&rdquo; Azalea said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid the
teachers won&rsquo;t do a thing but look out of the window.&nbsp;
Honestly, I&rsquo;ve never seen such views, and you know, Carin,
that first and last I&rsquo;ve seen something of the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I can paint,&rdquo; Carin sighed happily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall get up early mornings and work before
school.&nbsp; Oh, Azalea, anyone could learn to paint up
here&mdash;a person couldn&rsquo;t keep from painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could,&rdquo; Azalea had to admit.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know, Carin, if you were a wicked queen and threatened to cut my
head off if I didn&rsquo;t give you the picture of a cow,
I&rsquo;d send for my friends and relatives and bid them a
tearful good-bye, for I&rsquo;d know my last day had
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go to the house, my dears,&rdquo;
said Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that only proves to be anything
like as comfortable as the schoolhouse, we shall be fortunate
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed through a grove of maples, and followed a trail
once well worn, that led them by way of a little bridge over a
cheerfully noisy mountain stream to a little headland from which
the mountain shelved abruptly.&nbsp; Here, among towering white
pines, and seeming to be almost a part of the earth itself, stood
a little cabin of logs.&nbsp; They were square hewn, but so
weathered that their color was like that of the tree trunks, and
the slope of the roof was as graceful as the sweeping branches of
the great pines.&nbsp; The windows were closed with board
shutters, and the door&mdash;well-made and paneled&mdash;was
double-locked.&nbsp; Mis&rsquo; Cassie, however, was soon able to
admit her guests, and they stood for the first time within the
little room which was to live, forever after, in the minds of all
of them, as a place of peace.</p>
<p>It was a room of good size, divided after a fashion by a huge
&ldquo;rock&rdquo; chimney with a fireplace on each side of
it&mdash;an interesting fact which it did not take the delighted
girls long <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>to discover.&nbsp; A few simple pieces of furniture
stood about the room&mdash;some easy chairs, a settee, a table
and a clock.&nbsp; Behind the chimney was the bedroom.&nbsp; Here
stood two beds, a chest of drawers, some straight-backed chairs,
and a wide bench with pail, pitcher, and washbasin.&nbsp; There
was nothing more.&nbsp; Nothing more was needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the kitchen,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah, turning her
gaze reproachfully upon Mis&rsquo; Cassie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mis&rsquo; Cassie, &ldquo;sure
enough&mdash;the kitchen.&rdquo;&nbsp; She led the way through a
door they had not noticed, and there in a lean-to, with a spring
bubbling in a &ldquo;rock house&rdquo; fairly by the door, was
the little work room, with its small cooking stove and its
shelves of dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the dishes horrid?&rdquo; demanded Carin, fearing
the worst in the matter of china.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Azalea in the tone of one who makes a
discovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve pink towers on them and
pictures of trees.&nbsp; Oh, Carin, see, they&rsquo;re like that
plate your mother has!&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t they the
dears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Ravenel left them plates and cups,&rdquo;
volunteered Mis&rsquo; Cassie.&nbsp; &ldquo;She said when she put
&rsquo;em on the shelves that she did hope they&rsquo;d <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>fall into the
hands of some one who would set store by them.&nbsp; They was
what she used and she was mighty particular about them, but it
was such a chore toting things down the mountains and she&rsquo;d
had such a lot o&rsquo; trouble that she just left things behind
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, about all we brought was clothes and
bedding,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sister Adnah
wanted me to bring along dishes and pictures and curtains and all
manner of things, but I said &lsquo;No, wait.&nbsp; We
won&rsquo;t be needing pictures or curtains, where there&rsquo;s
a picture out of every window and no one to be looking in at
night, and if we&rsquo;ve no other dishes we can eat out of
gourds.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Zillah gave one of her odd little laughs&mdash;one of the
gypsy laughs in which she sometimes indulged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fit home for anybody,&rdquo; she
decided.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hardly wait to get my hands
on it and clean it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; cried
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. McEvoy can bring our things right here
when he comes, can&rsquo;t he, Mrs. McEvoy.&nbsp; Oh, yes, and is
there a place for the ponies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mis&rsquo; Cassie told them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The ponies <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>is to be kept at our place.&nbsp; Miles will fetch
&rsquo;em when you want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one is coming,&rdquo; said Azalea under her
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw some one walking along the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Azalea, anybody would think you were Robinson
Crusoe.&nbsp; Why should you be so surprised to see anybody
coming down the road?&rdquo; asked Carin.</p>
<p>Azalea did not answer for a moment.&nbsp; She moved nearer to
the door and looked out; then drew back suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said under her breath, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
that boy we saw on the cars&mdash;that young man, I mean.&nbsp;
You know&mdash;Keefe O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; said Carin in the most
matter-of-fact way.&nbsp; &ldquo;How jolly!&nbsp; Call him in,
Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Azalea, the friendly one, Azalea who always liked to talk
to people, and who, up at the McBirney cabin could hardly let
anyone pass the door without saying &ldquo;come in,&rdquo; held
back unaccountably.&nbsp; Miss Zillah and Mis&rsquo; Cassie were
still in the kitchen, so they could not be appealed to, and
finally it was Carin who ran out of the door and called.&nbsp;
But it really <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>was not necessary to call, for Keefe O&rsquo;Connor had
already discovered the little house dropped among the pines as
naturally as a ground-bird&rsquo;s nest, and he had turned aside
to investigate it.&nbsp; When he saw the open door and the girls,
he took off his hat and swung it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this great!&rdquo; he cried, not trying to
hide his delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here only half an hour,&rdquo; said
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;But in half an hour more I think we may
truthfully say that we are living here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe took it for granted that he was expected to enter.&nbsp;
He looked about the house with admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
a painter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carin&rsquo;s a painter,&rdquo; Azalea said
quickly.&nbsp; How wonderful, she thought, that both Keefe and
Carin should be artists.&nbsp; It ought to make them good
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you an artist too?&rdquo; asked Keefe, turning
his dark eyes on Azalea with laughing and admiring inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
nothing&mdash;just a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p64b.jpg">

 src="images/p64s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; he said, smiling radiantly.</p>
<p>Carin broke in cheerfully with:</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;And are you really staying around
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the
Hall.&nbsp; You remember little Miss Rowantree?&nbsp; Her father
and mother have consented to let me use one of their rooms.&nbsp;
They have a great many, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ravenel Hall?&rdquo; asked Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that
the same as Ravenel Hall?&nbsp; We have just been hearing
something of the Ravenels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called Rowantree Hall now,&rdquo; smiled
Keefe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Rowantree himself lives there.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s lord of the manor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he so magnificent?&rdquo; asked Carin, her eyes
widening.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought no one lived about here except
the mountain folk.&nbsp; Mr. Summers never told me anything about
Mr. Rowantree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Keefe O&rsquo;Connor, &ldquo;Mr.
Summers, whoever he may be, couldn&rsquo;t have known very much
about the country.&nbsp; To be sure, I haven&rsquo;t been here
long myself, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen I should say that Mr.
Rowantree was a very important character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell us&mdash;&rdquo; began Carin.&nbsp; But just
then Miss Zillah entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mrs. McEvoy has
kindly started the fire.&nbsp; Let us wash the dust <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>off the
dishes without delay.&nbsp; Mrs. McEvoy offers to provide us with
vegetables, and our supplies will soon be here, so presently we
shall have dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe came forward from the shadow of the huge chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I help with the dishes, please?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; If he saw in Miss Zillah&rsquo;s eyes a gleam of
annoyance that she should have a third person foisted upon her
care he paid no attention to it.&nbsp; She was too hospitable,
moreover, to refuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you do it well.&nbsp;
Then, having paid for your dinner beforehand, you shall eat it
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea, who was already in the kitchen, heard the
answer&mdash;and dropped the dipper.</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;SAY! TEACHER!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The schoolhouse was ready.&nbsp; The books and tablets,
pencils and stereopticon pictures ordered by Mr. Carson, all had
come.&nbsp; The little house of the schoolteachers was ready,
too.&nbsp; All that was wanting was the pupils.</p>
<p>But there was little doubt about them&mdash;they would soon be
coming, for posted at corners of the main traveled roads, nailed
on trees and tacked on station and post office walls were
placards bearing the information that the Ravenel School was open
and that all who wished to study would be welcomed.&nbsp; To make
plain the nature of the invitation even to those who could not
read, Carin painted on each placard a picture of the schoolhouse,
and put beyond it a beckoning hand, which, as she explained, was
her idea of sign writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, even the groundhogs and chipmunks ought to be able
to understand that,&rdquo; said Azalea.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Then
the services of the carrier of the rural mail and of the doctor
and the preacher were asked.&nbsp; Miles McEvoy made it his
business to send on the good word by everyone he saw going
mountainward.&nbsp; The grocer promised to let no mountaineer
leave his place without telling him of the news and asking the
person to whom he told it, to spread it far and wide.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that Azalea, sitting on the doorstep one
morning after her early breakfast, saw three heads appearing
above the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carin,&rdquo; she called.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; The gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; The pupils.&nbsp; Oh, where is the key to the
schoolhouse?&nbsp; Oh, Aunt Zillah, do I look in the least like a
teacher?&nbsp; Come, Carin, we must go meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Carin held back a little because she had a curiosity to
see how Azalea would meet these first seekers after
knowledge.&nbsp; They were three slender young creatures, two
boys and a girl, the eldest twelve, the girl not much younger,
and the second boy a mere wisp of a child who looked as if he had
been dragged along for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>Azalea had rushed forth from her door <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>impetuously,
the key to the schoolhouse in her hand, but Carin saw her check
herself and walk toward the children rather slowly.&nbsp; Anyone
looking at her would have said she was shy.&nbsp; But she was not
half so shy as the children.&nbsp; They had a certain dignity
about them, it is true, and looked as if they were there to face
whatever might come, but they, too, came forward slowly, looking
from the corners of their eyes, and with their heads
drooping.&nbsp; When Azalea got near them they stopped, and she
stopped too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; said Azalea in the mountain fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>A little silence fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you come up here to get learning?&rdquo; asked
Azalea quaintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; The girl added,
&ldquo;Please ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does amaze me,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah
under her breath to Carin, &ldquo;the good manners all the
mountain children have.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter from what
way-back cove they come, they seem to understand
politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Azalea clever?&rdquo; murmured Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I would probably have frightened them <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>so that
they&rsquo;d have scampered away like rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The schoolhouse is over yon,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
The three pupils nodded and when she set out they followed.&nbsp;
Carin joined them, walking a little behind the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your names?&rdquo; she heard Azalea ask
quietly&mdash;almost lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter,&rdquo; said the elder boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bud Coulter; my sister, she&rsquo;s called Mandy
Coulter.&nbsp; And this here is Babe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin ran forward and held out her hand to the little one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my hand, Babe,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; The child
drew back for a moment, looking up in Carin&rsquo;s face with
something like fear; but when he saw those beautiful blue eyes
which Azalea loved so well, and the shining mass of golden hair,
his mouth opened slowly like one who sees a vision, and when
Carin had grasped his thin little hand in her own, he walked
beside her quietly, though his heart beat so that it made his
homespun blouse rise and fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a boy living over beyant us that aims to
come to school if we like it,&rdquo; Mandy Coulter told
Azalea.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;Hush up,&rdquo; her brother whispered, poking her
reprovingly in the ribs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a
tell-all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll like it, I reckon,&rdquo; said
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s worth while to learn to
read and write, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; People who get on in the
world all know how to read and write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam Simms can&rsquo;t read nor write none,&rdquo; said
Bud, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s got six mules and ten head of cattle
and his own house and fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea flushed a little.&nbsp; It came back to her memory that
it was a part of the delight of mountain people to catch each
other tripping.&nbsp; They liked a tussle of wits; it was an
intellectual game with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s more
than one way of getting on, of course.&nbsp; But Mr. Simms must
have been a smart man to get all those things without having
reading and writing to help him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose
there&rsquo;s another man in the country who could have done that
and been so ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorant?&rdquo; retorted Bud Coulter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
ain&rsquo;t ignorant.&nbsp; He knows just what to do for sick
horses and how to gather in swarming bees and lots of other
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;How clever of him,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Bud
emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s about the meanest man
around.&nbsp; He can shoot like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea stopped him on that last word.&nbsp; She knew quite
certainly what it was going to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t want to shoot me, would he?&rdquo;
she asked smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only wanted to meet him
because he could do so many things, although he could not do the
best ones&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t read in books what other men
thought, and he couldn&rsquo;t write down any of his own
thoughts.&nbsp; That leaves him in a bad way, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Many men not nearly so clever could get ahead of
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Azalea paused a moment.&nbsp; Then she cried:
&ldquo;Why, come in, quick, and I can show you how to get ahead
of him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud&rsquo;s calm was broken.&nbsp; He looked at Azalea for the
first time as &ldquo;teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you, now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She threw open the schoolroom door, showed the children where
to put their hats and ran to the blackboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me your real name,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely it isn&rsquo;t Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Laurence Babbitt
Coulter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laurence Babbitt Coulter,&rdquo; she wrote on the
blackboard in very plain letters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you write
that, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know your letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the end of the week,&rdquo; said Azalea with
decision, &ldquo;you will know your letters and you will be able
to write your own name.&nbsp; Then you can do something that Mr.
Simms can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can come it over him,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He was
again enjoying the encounter of wits.&nbsp; This made Azalea say
hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course, since he&rsquo;s so much older than you,
Bud, you mustn&rsquo;t let him know that you can come it over
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I must,&rdquo; cried the boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been mean to my pa.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the
meanest man in these parts, and he&rsquo;s got a son&mdash;at
least it ain&rsquo;t really his son&mdash;it&rsquo;s his
brother&rsquo;s son&mdash;who&rsquo;s so meachin&rsquo; that he
don&rsquo;t even know enough to be mean, and if that
white-livered boob tries to come up here to this here
school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll teach him how to write his name,
too,&rdquo; said Azalea valorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay in no school that Skully Simms comes
to,&rdquo; declared Bud.</p>
<p>Azalea threw a glance at Carin, who was sitting in one of the
school seats beside Babe, and whose face had turned rather
white.&nbsp; Carin had been prepared for gratitude from the
pupils; it had never occurred to her that they would come to
school in a warring attitude.&nbsp; Moreover, for the first time
she realized what a young girl Azalea still was.&nbsp; As her
Zalie stood there on the platform, her hair rumpled by the wind,
her face flushed with perplexity, her frock coming just below her
shoe tops, she looked very tender and youthful indeed.&nbsp; But
she had what Sam Disbrow would have called &ldquo;the fighting
stuff&rdquo; in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This school is for learning,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and learning has nothing to do with friend or foe.&nbsp;
It is for all alike.&nbsp; Chinamen with cues down their backs,
Arabs riding on camels over the desert, East Indians, all dressed
in white with turbans on their heads, may be learned.&nbsp; They
live on the other side of the world&mdash;quite on the other side
of this great ball we call the earth&mdash;<a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>but they have
just as much right to get learning as we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin had an idea.&nbsp; She jumped from her seat and ran to
the blackboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a picture of a camel?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Before the children could answer she had begun sketching
one.&nbsp; She had colored chalks, and in a moment or two her
brown camel was surrounded by a stretch of desert sand.&nbsp; Far
off, a fronded palm indicated an oasis.&nbsp; Then she began
telling them what the picture meant; she told them of the desert
and the life on it, and of the old, old learning of the
Arabs.&nbsp; The children sat spellbound.</p>
<p>When she had finished, Azalea took up a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said quietly but in a tone from which
there was no demurring, &ldquo;we will learn our
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud gave her one last defiant glance; then his eyes fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Half an hour later two more pupils came, one a red-headed boy
named Dibblee Sikes, the other a girl called Paralee Panther,
with astonishingly <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>heavy eyebrows, a sullen look and only one arm.&nbsp;
She was the only one of the pupils who really knew how to
read.&nbsp; Moreover, she was, under all her sullenness, wild to
learn more.&nbsp; With her heavy eyes she watched every move that
Carin or Azalea made; she listened eagerly and yet as if only
half understanding, to all they said.</p>
<p>After school was over, Azalea, more tired mentally than she
ever remembered to have been in her life, walked beside this girl
for a way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that you have been taught?&rdquo; asked
Azalea.</p>
<p>The girl did not seem to understand.&nbsp; At least, she
failed to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught you your letters?&rdquo; Azalea asked
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she live around here?&nbsp; Was it Mrs.
Ravenel&rsquo;s teacher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t belong hereabouts.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve just come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; said Azalea with interest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And do you live near?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not really!&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s too far for
you <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>to
walk every day.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you live somewhere nearer while
school lasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m content where I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the walk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can walk it,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; Compared
with her heavy sulkiness, Bud Coulter&rsquo;s habit of arguing
was blitheness itself.&nbsp; However, as Azalea turned at the
house door to look after her strange group of pupils, Dibblee,
the red-headed boy, waved his hand, and little Babe Coulter
called: &ldquo;Say, teacher, I&rsquo;m coming
nex&rsquo;-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped in the house with Carin beside her, to find Miss
Zillah and Mrs. McEvoy waiting anxiously to get a report of the
first day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them Coulters,&rdquo; said Mrs. McEvoy when she heard
the name of the first pupils mentioned, &ldquo;are the ones that
have a war with the Simmses.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve kept it up for
twenty years and more.&nbsp; Seems like they&rsquo;re set on
seeing which can kill the others off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Azalea, &ldquo;is it really one of
those dreadful mountain quarrels?&nbsp; Mrs. McEvoy, do you
suppose we could do anything to break it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>Mis&rsquo; Cassie threw an amused and commiserating look
at Azalea, who was looking, for her, white-faced and
nervous&mdash;not that Azalea&rsquo;s cheeks could really fade
out completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d aim to do that,&rdquo;
she said dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You &rsquo;tend to your teaching,
Miss Azalea, and perhaps the light of learning may show them the
folly of walking in dark ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin was telling about Paralee Panther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one of them Panthers,&rdquo; said Mrs.
McEvoy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re strangers.&nbsp; Nobody takes
to them much&mdash;can&rsquo;t get it out of them where they come
from nor what they aim to do.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve all got heavy
looks, but that girl&rsquo;s the worst of the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite a contrast to Dibblee Sikes,&rdquo;
mused Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s a right peart boy!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. McEvoy with unusual enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
blessing to his mother, and a fine friendly lad
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was time to get supper and Carin and Azalea insisted on
helping Miss Zillah, though they would have been particularly
glad to have <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>snuggled down on the settee and forgotten the
world.&nbsp; They had promised Annie Laurie that Aunt Zillah
should not be allowed to get weary and they were determined to
keep their word.&nbsp; But after supper Miss Zillah insisted on
stacking the dishes away until morning.&nbsp; She said she wanted
to sew and talk, and that doing the dishes the next day would
help her to pass the time.&nbsp; So while she put some tiny tucks
in a summer frock for Annie Laurie, the girls told her of
everything that had happened during the day.&nbsp; Miss Zillah
was rather dismayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand about those children,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their spirits don&rsquo;t seem to be
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, by the end of the week, there was much more
encouraging news to give her.&nbsp; The children who joined the
school along toward the last of the week were milder and better
mannered than those who had come at first.&nbsp; It seemed as if
the more obstinate and ill-tempered had come first to try out the
young teachers.&nbsp; Poor Skully Simms, the nephew of the man
who had a &ldquo;war&rdquo; with the Coulters, dared not show his
face.&nbsp; Mrs. McEvoy heard that he was &ldquo;wishful&rdquo;
to come, but was afraid of Bud <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Coulter.&nbsp; One day Azalea caught
a glimpse of a face at the window, and after school Dibblee Sikes
told her that it was Skully Simms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jest pestered to know what we-all are
doing,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s skeered of
Bud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might ride down and see him,&rdquo; said
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I could coax him to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if he got in bad with Bud and there was
blood-shedding,&rdquo; said Dibblee wisely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be
taking blame to yourself.&nbsp; It might break up the school,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; That would do harm to the whole lot of
us.&nbsp; Folks around here don&rsquo;t believe in stirring up
the Coulters and Simms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let sleeping dogs lie,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp; You know
the neighbors and I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was glad when Keefe O&rsquo;Connor volunteered to come in
every afternoon and teach the upper class boys geography and what
he called &ldquo;current history.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a notion
that what they needed more than anything else was to have some
notion of what was going on in the outside world.&nbsp; He said
he always managed to be followed by a New York newspaper no
matter how far in the backwoods he went.&nbsp; He had <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>left
Rowantree Hall, partly because he had no wish to put the family
to further trouble, but chiefly because he wanted to be nearer
the school, where he meant to lend a hand now and then.&nbsp; A
tent appeared miraculously on the mountainside, to which Keefe
proudly gave the name of &ldquo;home.&rdquo;&nbsp; He arose early
and painted during the morning hours; then, after his dinner,
cooked in the open, he helped at school.&nbsp; After that, as the
shadows deepened and lay across the slopes, he went back to his
canvas and brushes.&nbsp; Carin was wild to join him, but the
truth was that those first few days of teaching drained every
drop of strength in her, and Azalea and Aunt Zillah hurried her
into her bed immediately after supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad,&rdquo; she complained to
Aunt Zillah, half laughing and half in earnest, &ldquo;if it
wasn&rsquo;t for that dreadful Paralee Panther.&nbsp; She seems
like a bad dream; the only trouble is I can&rsquo;t wake
up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to think I had imagined her.&nbsp; But
she is real and needs us more, I suspect, than anybody else in
the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always frowning and watching,&rdquo; Azalea
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes me want to scream.&nbsp; Carin, did
you ever see anybody with such heavy <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>eyelids?&nbsp; And Aunt Zillah, she
watches at us from the corners of her eyes.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
just hate a trick like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ever could she have lost her arm?&rdquo; wondered
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;A boy might have shot his off, but it&rsquo;s
strange for a girl to have lost an arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Aunt Zillah philosophically,
&ldquo;we came up here to find some queer people, and we&rsquo;re
not disappointed.&nbsp; Queerness often means unhappiness,
that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve discovered.&nbsp; If you girls
succeed in doing what you came up to do and help these poor
people out of some of their troubles and drawbacks, perhaps they
won&rsquo;t be so queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evenings at home&mdash;they called the cottage
&ldquo;home&rdquo; now and had named it the &ldquo;Oriole&rsquo;s
Nest&rdquo;&mdash;were very restful and delightful.&nbsp; If
Carin went to bed, she did so on the couch in the sitting room,
so that she might be with the others.&nbsp; Sometimes Aunt Zillah
sewed&mdash;always for Annie Laurie&mdash;and sometimes she read
aloud.&nbsp; Azalea had some crocheting with which she busied
herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson had taught her to make some beautiful
things, and Azalea had developed a sort of passion <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>for
them.&nbsp; She wanted to make something lovely for everyone she
loved; and Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s last gift to her had been a great
quantity of beautiful wools of many delicate shades.</p>
<p>Keefe O&rsquo;Connor dropped in the little house evenings,
too, and added to the gayety by &ldquo;picking&rdquo; on the
guitar which he had borrowed from the McEvoys.&nbsp; Sitting on
the doorstep, his handsome head thrown back against the casing,
his dark eyes fixed with something like yearning affection on the
group in the room, he crept, brotherly fashion, into the heart of
each of them.&nbsp; He did not explain himself&mdash;said nothing
of his parents, of his past, of his means of living&mdash;yet he
seemed to have for his own Bohemian purposes, all that he needed,
and to be happy in spite of that curious wistfulness which
everyone felt who came near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem as if he was honing for something,&rdquo;
Mrs. McEvoy said one day when he was under discussion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It may only be liver trouble, of course.&nbsp; If so, I
could help him out there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got three bottles of
liver special that I ain&rsquo;t never took.&nbsp; Or if
it&rsquo;s indigestion or rheumatism, there again I could be of
aid to him.&nbsp; I was saying to Miles the other night, seems as
if, since you <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>folks came, I didn&rsquo;t pay half the attention to my
medicine that I used to.&nbsp; Aside from them two bottles in the
kitchen, I don&rsquo;t call on none of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if those two bottles weren&rsquo;t sitting where
you could see them,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah with unusual
boldness, &ldquo;probably you wouldn&rsquo;t be taking the
medicine from them.&nbsp; I do say, Mrs. McEvoy, and I&rsquo;ll
abide by it, that health is nine-tenths a matter of good food,
good air and a happy heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, la,&rdquo; said Mrs. McEvoy with more temper than
any of them had yet seen in her, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy for you
to say that, Miss Pace, when you&rsquo;ve got your health.&nbsp;
But if you&rsquo;d been through what I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not bring herself to finish, but suddenly
remembering that she had some baking to do, left hastily and
walked with unusual swingings of her body down the path that led
to her home.</p>
<p>The path was getting pretty well worn now, and the dwellers in
the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest were well pleased that it was so.&nbsp;
They were attached to Mis&rsquo; Cassie McEvoy, and were a good
deal worried that she seemed displeased with them.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to knock Bluebeard and the
Princess Madeline off the shelf and break them to
flinders,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp; They all called Mrs.
McEvoy&rsquo;s favorite bottles by the names Azalea had given
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;It could be done so accidentally that
she&rsquo;d think it was the cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try anything like that,
Carin.&nbsp; Folks have to work out their own liberty.&nbsp; It
can&rsquo;t be done for them by anybody else, though a little
help may be given now and then.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll bake
some of those cookies that Mis&rsquo; Cassie likes, and I can
send some over to her when Mr. McEvoy comes with the milk.&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t have her offended with me for
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Zillah always contrived to be busy, it seemed, and she
could keep those around her busy, too.&nbsp; She was quite
determined that there should be nothing slipshod about the
Oriole&rsquo;s Nest, and had laid out a fine set of rules for
work which had to be followed.&nbsp; Even Keefe&mdash;who had
soon fallen into the way of having his dinner with them&mdash;had
his duties.&nbsp; At night, when Miss Zillah supervised the last
offices of the day, it was he who brought in the pails of <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>fresh water
from the spring, and who filled the wood box.&nbsp; When he had
said good night&mdash;lingering a little&mdash;Miss Zillah locked
the doors and drew the curtains.&nbsp; Then she waited till the
girls were snug in bed, and kissing them with gentle seriousness,
turned out the light.</p>
<p>It made it a touch less lonely for them all to hear Keefe
whistling on his way to his tent-home.&nbsp; He had made it quite
&ldquo;shipshape&rdquo; and he took a genuine pride in it.&nbsp;
But he did not sleep in it; instead, he slung his hammock from
the trees and rested there in moonshine or star-light.&nbsp; Even
a light rain could not drive him in.&nbsp; Then, in the morning
early, having cooked his breakfast, he was off with his
painter&rsquo;s kit.&nbsp; But his duties seemed always to take
him past the door of the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest, and as he passed he
called out mockingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It won him a blithe signal from some one&mdash;possibly from
all three of the cottage dwellers.</p>
<h2><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROWANTREE HALL</span></h2>
<p>The third Sunday of their sojourn on the mountain, they
accepted an invitation to Rowantree Hall.&nbsp; Keefe
O&rsquo;Connor had been the messenger, bringing the invitation by
word of mouth, and though Miss Zillah was not quite sure about
the propriety of accepting, the girls overbore all
objections.&nbsp; So it was agreed that Keefe was to be their
guide there and back&mdash;to which end he borrowed one of Miles
McEvoy&rsquo;s horses&mdash;and they set forth in the middle of a
shimmering July forenoon.&nbsp; Keefe and Miss Zillah rode ahead;
Azalea and Carin followed on their ponies, each of the feminine
members of the party carrying in a neat saddlebag a clean summer
frock to be donned upon arriving.</p>
<p>They followed the main traveled road but a short way, turning
off presently on what looked like an old wood road.&nbsp; It was
almost overgrown with huckleberries and little pines, and the
farther they went, the prettier and wilder it grew.&nbsp; <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>At length
they entered a magnificent piece of woodland where the chestnut
and the maple, the tulip and the gum, the chestnut oak and the
red oak and many other beautiful trees grew together.&nbsp; Then
behold, in the midst of this they came upon a gateway made of
great logs, with an iron lantern hanging from each end of the
crosspiece, and above it in rustic letters the words
&ldquo;Rowantree Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said Carin, &ldquo;as if I might come
upon the Sleeping Princess at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I feel,&rdquo; Azalea answered, &ldquo;as if we
might all be turned into sleeping princesses.&nbsp; Oh, Keefe,
are you sure this is not an enchanted wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe looked back over his shoulder gayly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you know of any way of keeping off
enchantments&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to keep them off,&rdquo; Carin
called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, how wonderful it all is!&nbsp; Aunt
Zillah, we are going to have an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Aunt Zillah, quite as
light-hearted and care-free as any of the young people.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is impossible to avoid adventures.&nbsp; Life itself is
an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had to ride a mile after they entered <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>the gate
before they came to the house, and the only indications that they
were near the habitation of man were the paths which ran here and
there among laurel or rhododendron, and the rustic seats which
were placed at intervals along the way.&nbsp; But at last the
house arose before them.&nbsp; It had started out to be what Mr.
Carson would have called a Southern mansion.&nbsp; The double
gallery should have been supported by fluted pillars, but instead
of these classic shafts, the boles of eight great chestnut trees
served the purpose.&nbsp; The house had never been properly
painted, only &ldquo;primed&rdquo; with ochre which had faded
until it was almost the color of the ground around it, but over
this had grown a multitude of vines.&nbsp; English ivy, Virginia
creeper, trumpet flower, honeysuckle, purple and white clematis,
the Dorothy Perkins rose and the matrimony vine climbed, ramped,
and enwrapped according to their dispositions, till the ragged
looking house was as gay as a castle with banners.</p>
<p>On the lower gallery, in white linen, very stately and
hospitable in appearance, sat Rowantree himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasure to have guests,&rdquo; he said <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>with an
English accent, coming forward to assist Miss Zillah from her
horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have been looking forward to this honor
with the greatest appreciation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Zillah could be stately herself when occasion demanded,
and she was quite as polite as Mr. Rowantree when she thanked
him.&nbsp; If Mr. Rowantree could have had his way, he would have
beaten his hands together and summoned his slaves to lead the
horses to the stables.&nbsp; But the truth&mdash;the bare and
undecorated truth&mdash;was that there were neither slaves nor
stables, the first never having come into Mr. Rowantree&rsquo;s
life, and the second having been burned to the ground a few years
back.&nbsp; But the horses, which Mr. Rowantree and Keefe cared
for, were no doubt much happier let loose in a field near at
hand.&nbsp; The ponies in particular were enthusiastic, and their
cheerful neighings could be heard at intervals the rest of the
day.</p>
<p>Aunt Zillah, followed by her two girls, entered what the
Rowantrees were pleased to call their
&ldquo;drawing-room.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was large enough to deserve
the name, no question about that.&nbsp; And the outlook from its
great windows was so beautiful&mdash;the house being on a rise
and overlooking <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>the forest about it and glimpsing the mountains
beyond&mdash;that curtains would have been a mere drawback.&nbsp;
Nor could any wall covering have been softer in color than the
gray building paper which had been tacked on the joists of the
house, since the builders never had got as far as lath and
plaster.&nbsp; There was no chimney shelf, but there was a large
fireplace, heaped for the occasion with oleander leaves.&nbsp; A
few pieces of fine mahogany furniture were surrounded by the
rudest mountain chairs, and the wall decorations consisted of a
beautiful clock which kept the time of sunrise and moonrise as
well as the hours of the day; in addition there were two fine,
mellow portraits in oil, a fowling piece, two broken tennis
rackets and some mountain baskets.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah was too delicate-minded to take stock of
anybody&rsquo;s possessions, but the eager girls, set on their
own sort of an adventure, noticed these odds and ends with one
sweep of their eyes.&nbsp; Then, the next moment, the mistress of
the house entered, and all was forgotten in looking at her.</p>
<p>She was taller than Barbara Summers, whom they both used as a
standard for sweet women, but still she was small.&nbsp; Her face
was unmistakably <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Irish; her eyes gray-misted blue, her hair as black as
Keefe O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her mouth was sad and glad at
once, and there was a strange, appealing look in her face as of
wanting something.&nbsp; She seemed homesick for
something&mdash;perhaps for something she never had had.&nbsp;
The girls felt that if she had a happy time she wouldn&rsquo;t,
in the midst of it, be able to forget sorrow; and that if she
were very sorrowful, she would still manage to hold on to
joy.&nbsp; Carin said afterward that her face made her think of
Ellen Terry&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Azalea had not, of course, seen this
great actress, but she, too, thought somehow of acting.&nbsp; As
soon as Mrs. Rowantree began to talk, Azalea felt as if she were
in a story book or on the stage.&nbsp; Like Rowantree himself,
his wife was dressed in white, but it was, as Azalea could not
help noticing, a very old frock with various rents in it, just as
Mr. Rowantree&rsquo;s linen was frayed and ragged.&nbsp; But
these things seemed, somehow, to make the &ldquo;adventure&rdquo;
all the more interesting.&nbsp; Mrs. Rowantree had quick, gay
motions, and she walked down the length of the long curious room
as if she were tripping on her toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Pace, it&rsquo;s a great pleasure to be meeting <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>you,&rdquo;
she said, not waiting for an introduction, but grasping Miss
Zillah&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; To Carin and Azalea she said:
&ldquo;Young faces are flowers at the feast!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her way
was so quaintly old-fashioned, so charming, so dramatic, that
Azalea again thought of play-acting; yet Mrs. Rowantree was
nothing, it seemed, if not sincere.&nbsp; So perhaps it was best,
Azalea decided, to think of this as the most charming
&ldquo;really truly&rdquo; thing that had come her way.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah made it known that they were not content to remain
in their riding clothes, and Mrs. Rowantree offered their
apologies to her husband with pretty ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ladies wish to be excused, my dear,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have to make themselves more acceptable
to the gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; She contrived to include Keefe in
the little bow she swept them.&nbsp; So the four ladies were off
up a stairway designed for a magnificent hand rail, but having
nothing better in the way of a balustrade than a stout rope
strung through posts.</p>
<p>Upstairs the appearance of things was even more bare and
unsettled than below.&nbsp; The room to which they were taken was
that occupied, apparently, by Mr. and Mrs. Rowantree, <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and here was
almost nothing in the way of furniture beyond the beds and a most
elaborate dressing case belonging to Rowantree himself, spread
out on a table before a triplicate mirror.&nbsp; Opposite it
stood another table above which hung a very small mirror, where,
it was evident by the meager little feminine articles, Mary
Cecily Rowantree made her toilet.&nbsp; The celluloid brushes
were in great contrast to the gold-stoppered, tortoise shell
contrivances in Mr. Rowantree&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>While the white frocks were being put on, Mrs. Rowantree lent
a hand with deftness and gayety.&nbsp; She delighted in
Carin&rsquo;s golden hair and in Aunt Zillah&rsquo;s beautiful
silver curls.&nbsp; She said Azalea was like a rose, and that
Constance had done nothing but talk of her since the day on the
train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rowantree, &ldquo;are in
the nursery waiting impatiently to see you.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
appeared that every bare room in the great unfinished house had
its name.</p>
<p>When they all rustled down in their white gowns, Mr. Rowantree
greeted them magnificently at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the children brought, my dear,&rdquo; he <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>said to his
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;They naturally are eager to be
released.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his tone one would have expected the children to enter
accompanied by at least a governess and a nurse, but it was the
little proud mother herself who brought in Gerald&mdash;&ldquo;my
eldest son, Miss Pace,&rdquo;&mdash;and Moira and
Michael&mdash;&ldquo;my darling twins, young
ladies,&rdquo;&mdash;and led by the hand that wise young person,
Constance, who flew like a bird to Azalea&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rowantree,
&ldquo;fierce in her affections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, so am I,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. McBirney, my adopted father, always tells
me that.&nbsp; He wants me to be calm, but I can&rsquo;t stay
calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Cecily Rowantree gave a rippling laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why be calm,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when you can be
having a fine excitement about something or other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Irish blood in her,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Rowantree benevolently, &ldquo;that makes my wife like
that.&nbsp; I am not so easily amused myself.&nbsp; A quiet life,
that&rsquo;s what suits me best.&nbsp; I ask nothing <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>better than
to sit on my gallery and look at my peaceful trees.&nbsp; My
dear, dinner will be served ere long, I take it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again it seemed as if there must be a cook and cook&rsquo;s
assistants, scullions and servitors not far off.&nbsp; But again
it was little Mrs. Rowantree who dashed to fill orders.&nbsp;
Miss Zillah was persuaded to join Mr. Rowantree on the gallery,
but Carin and Azalea insisted on going into the kitchen to help,
for by this time they were quite aware of the condition of
things.&nbsp; It was quite evident that Mr. Rowantree had an
imagination, and not only saw some things which did not exist,
but contrived not to see the unpleasant ones that did.</p>
<p>However, as the four handsome children persisted in tagging
their mother into the kitchen, Mrs. Rowantree said to Carin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really wanting to help&mdash;and I can
see your heart&rsquo;s in it&mdash;would you mind telling a story
to the young ones off somewhere?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re always under
my feet, and while goodness knows I love to have them hanging
about me, they are a hindrance to the getting of the
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Story?&rdquo; cried Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
twenty.&nbsp; <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>Come, children!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she vanished, followed
not only by the four young Rowantrees, but by Keefe
O&rsquo;Connor as well.</p>
<p>So it was Azalea who had the next hour with the hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d eat on the gallery,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;It gives us a fine outlook over the
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no table on the gallery, but boards laid on
sawhorses served every purpose, and the linen which Mrs.
Rowantree gave Azalea to spread over this rude table was of the
finest, most beautiful damask.&nbsp; The dishes, on the other
hand, were of the commonest and had evidently been purchased at
Bee Tree or some similar mart.&nbsp; But as for the food, Mrs.
Rowantree knew how to manage that.&nbsp; She evidently made a
fine art of seasoning, and while, as she said, they &ldquo;had
not the advantage of markets&rdquo; at Rowantree Hall, they
contrived, apparently, to get plenty to eat.</p>
<p>It was quite a formal moment when Rowantree himself waved them
all to their seats.&nbsp; He placed Miss Zillah&rsquo;s chair for
her magnificently, while Keefe placed Mrs.
Rowantree&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Miss <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Zillah was made to feel the
distinction conferred upon her by being placed at the right hand
of her host, who proceeded to carve his barnyard fowl with as
many gestures as a trencher man of the Middle Ages might have
used in carving the wild boar.</p>
<p>The Rowantree children apparently forgot nothing in the way of
manners&mdash;at least so far as outward appearances went.&nbsp;
It is true that Carin received a bad kick in the shins which was
not intended for her; and that Azalea had to hold Moira&rsquo;s
hand to keep her from pinching her twin, but nothing could be
sweeter than the way they thanked their father when he served
them with food, or the smiling manner in which they answered
questions.</p>
<p>While they sat there, it began to rain softly, gray, bead-like
drops falling from the gallery&rsquo;s edge to the ground, and
hanging a soft shining curtain between them and the outer
world.&nbsp; Azalea never forgot the beauty of it all.&nbsp;
There was no wind, and they were quite as comfortable behind
their silver curtain as they would have been in the
house&mdash;more so, indeed, for the day had been a hot
one.&nbsp; Delicious odors came up from the ground; the birds
gave forth contented, <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>throaty sounds, and all the regal
midsummer mountain world seemed well content.</p>
<p>They were very happy together, with a freedom from care that
does not often come in this rather grim world.&nbsp; Only in the
eyes of Mary Cecily Rowantree there remained that strange look of
longing, of forever searching for something which she could not
find.&nbsp; Keefe O&rsquo;Connor caught it, and
sympathized.&nbsp; Azalea saw it, and because she too had a
hurt&mdash;as orphans must needs have&mdash;she too
understood.&nbsp; Those who have a sorrow belong to a great
brotherhood and know each other by secret signs.</p>
<p>But it was a happy dinner for all of that.&nbsp; Between
courses Rowantree himself offered to sing them an old ballad, and
in a rich bass voice which set the echoes of the wood at work, he
thundered the lines of &ldquo;The Maid of Bohea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was great applause, and he sang again.&nbsp; It was to his
singing of &ldquo;Bold Robin Hood,&rdquo; that Azalea and his
wife brought in the custard pie and the homemade cheese, and to
the sad strains of &ldquo;A Sailor There Was&rdquo; that they
finally cleared the table.&nbsp; After dinner everyone turned in
to help, save the master of the house, who still felt the need of
quiet and of <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>looking down what he called &ldquo;the approach,&rdquo;
by which he meant the winding road that led from the house to the
gate.</p>
<p>If Mr. Rowantree could sing old English ballads, Mrs.
Rowantree could sing, most bewitchingly, old Irish lyrics.&nbsp;
Carin and Azalea could sing, too, though not like their friend
Annie Laurie.&nbsp; Keefe had plenty of good will even if he had
not much of a voice, and Miss Zillah had a sweet little silver
thread of song which she was not ashamed to display.&nbsp; So
among them they had a musical afternoon, accompanied by one and
another on the old square piano with its rattling keys.&nbsp; The
gentle shower that had fallen during dinner had passed as quietly
as it came, and the sun shone softly through the wet shining
leaves of the trees into the room.</p>
<p>However, it was just before going home that Azalea had her
real &ldquo;adventure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Rowantree had drawn her
arm through her own, and the two of them had strolled together
down one of the laurel-edged paths of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keefe O&rsquo;Connor has been telling me your
story,&rdquo; Mary Cecily said gently, &ldquo;and I want <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>to say that
it&rsquo;s myself who knows how to sympathize with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Azalea replied with a sharp little catch of
the breath, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone had told Keefe
about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear but the story will follow you,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Rowantree with an accent of wisdom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stories good and bad have a way of following one.&nbsp;
But this I will say, Miss Azalea: I honor you for what
you&rsquo;ve done and the way you&rsquo;ve clung to those who
took you in when you were homeless.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very like my
own story&mdash;very like, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; asked Azalea, forgetting herself at once
and warming to her companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been alone in
the world, Mrs. Rowantree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone in a way you never were, Miss Azalea, for I lost
through my own heedlessness the one living creature that should
have been my care, and the knowledge of it is always eating at my
heart in spite of my good husband and my blessed
babes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Rowantree,&rdquo; cried the girl, distressed,
&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you blaming yourself for something that
wasn&rsquo;t really your fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Mary
Cecily turned her misty eyes toward Azalea, tragedy brooding in
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to hear my story,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;sit here and I will tell it to you.&nbsp; My good husband
doesn&rsquo;t like me to talk of it, but my sorrow gets pent in
me and tears me, which is what he doesn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be better for telling you the strange tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rude bench beneath a fine sour-wood tree, and
Azalea, sitting Turk-wise at one end so that she might face her
companion, prepared to give her attention to the &ldquo;strange
tale&rdquo;&mdash;and she thrilled as she did so, for she loved
strange tales with a great love.</p>

103</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LITTLE BROTHER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rowantree with her delicate
Irish accent, &ldquo;was a gentleman&mdash;a scholar and a
gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused a moment in that little
dramatic way of hers and then went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But my mother
was a cottager&rsquo;s daughter, very sweet and lovely to see,
but lacking the fine ways of himself.&nbsp; He gave up his
friends for her sake, and they left the village where they were
known and went to live in Dublin where my father made a living by
writing for the newspapers and reviews.&nbsp; I was born the
second year of their marriage, and seven years later my little
brother David came into the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused again,
but this time because there was a tightening in her throat which
would not let her go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was the finest baby I
ever laid my eyes on, and I&rsquo;ve had some fine ones of my
own.&nbsp; He was a treasure from the first, <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>but the
older he grew the nicer he became, till, when he was three years
of age, he was the pride of the neighborhood.&nbsp; People
stopped my mother on the street for the privilege of looking at
him.&nbsp; He had laughing black eyes and curly black hair, and
the oddest little turns to his baby talk that ever were
heard.&nbsp; Oh, we were so happy with him&mdash;so wrapped up in
him.&nbsp; Indeed, you&rsquo;d have looked well through Dublin
before finding a home equal to our own for contentment.&nbsp; My
father was getting some little fame for his writing, and my
mother no longer had to slave for us the way she did at
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, just as we were at our happiest, father came home
with a chill.&nbsp; I well remember it.&nbsp; We were watching
for him at the window, David and mother and I, and we had a meat
pie because of his liking for it, and we had taught David to say
&lsquo;Four and Twenty Blackbirds.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, we were
counting on such a happy evening!&nbsp; But when dad came in, he
did not speak to us for the anguish that was on him, and mother
got him in his bed, and he never got out of it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, me!&rdquo; said Azalea softly.</p>
<p>A little silence fell in which Mary Cecily <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Rowantree
locked and unlocked her thin, nervous fingers in a way of her
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after he was gone,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;we
had nothing.&nbsp; Never had he earned enough for my mother to
put by any savings.&nbsp; So we took to selling off what was in
the house, and she to doing sewing and embroidering, but in a
little while she saw it was no use&mdash;there&rsquo;d be nothing
for us but starvation unless some great piece of fortune befell
us.&nbsp; My mother was a devout woman and she prayed morning and
night and often through the day for help for her children, and
her prayers, she thought, were answered when word came from my
father&rsquo;s brother who was in America, that if she&rsquo;d
bring the children to him, he&rsquo;d care for them with his own,
and she could be about some kind of work.&nbsp; In America, he
said, there were chances.&nbsp; He sent us money for the journey,
but not very much&mdash;all he could afford, of course.&nbsp; So
mother, who was not afraid to do anything for her
children&rsquo;s sake, took passage with other poor people in the
steerage of a great ship sailing from Queenstown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little dear,&rdquo; said Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little dear!&rdquo; echoed Mary Cecily.&nbsp; <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;There were swarms of us on that boat.&nbsp; We
were all huddled and mixed; a torment to each other, with the
number of us.&nbsp; And the sea was very rough.&nbsp; Day after
day it stormed, and my little mother, worn with work and worry,
was ill unto death.&nbsp; Others were ill, but not so cold, so
weak, so weary as she.&nbsp; But few could give her
attention.&nbsp; They said: &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll be well in a
while.&rsquo;&nbsp; But she woke me one night and told me she
would never be well; that she could feel her heart giving
way.&nbsp; She gave me the address of my uncle, and told me not
to lose it whatever I did, and she had me pin the money that was
left, on my little shirt and told me God would raise up friends
for me, who would give me directions to my uncle&rsquo;s door,
and that once there I was safe.&nbsp; I listened till she had
finished and then I ran for help.&nbsp; At first the ship&rsquo;s
doctor did not want to come out of his warm berth, but I got on
my knees to him and he came.&nbsp; He thought &rsquo;twas only a
case of seasickness, and maybe he was right.&nbsp; But my little
lion-hearted one died that night.&nbsp; So David and I were alone
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The memory of the old anguish was upon her, and she stared
before her at the great trees of <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>her &ldquo;estate,&rdquo; all of her
life dropping back to that bleak hour when she was left an orphan
among those many poor in the great ship&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Azalea, &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t
think about it, Mrs. Rowantree.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how I manage
to get along.&nbsp; I say to myself: &lsquo;My sorrow is
sacred.&nbsp; I will not take it out and look at it often.&nbsp;
I will leave it in a holy place.&nbsp; It will be safe
there.&nbsp; I will go my way, doing happy, common
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you look at your trouble that
way, Mrs. Rowantree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Cecily turned her misty blue eyes on Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My girl,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;I have not
yet told you of my real trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea caught her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they dropped my little mother in the sea, a good
priest saying the words of the church over her.&nbsp; Some were
kind to us, but after all it was not many who were knowing
us.&nbsp; The wild weather kept up, and hundreds there were on
the ship who did not leave their beds at all.&nbsp; David and I
had no heart for talking, and we kept much to ourselves as we had
seen our mother do.&nbsp; There were rough people all about <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>us, and our
ways were gentle, so oftentimes we did not feel at home with
them.&nbsp; I kept up my heart by thinking of David and what I
must do for him; and now that mother was gone, he clung to me all
of the time.&nbsp; He could hardly breathe without me it seemed,
and though I was only ten years old, I had the mother-feeling in
me, and I prized myself for the sake of my little
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; Azalea murmured from her
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got to the landing place at last, and I was
near suffocated with the beating of my heart.&nbsp; I was as
afraid of the city as if it had been a dragon.&nbsp; The fear of
cities always was in me, but no city&mdash;not Calcutta, not Hong
Kong, nor any foreign place&mdash;could have seemed more terrible
to me than New York.&nbsp; &lsquo;For David&rsquo;s sake I must
be brave,&rsquo; I kept saying to myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
David&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, the first and second-class
passengers were let off, and then came our turn.&nbsp; I never
did know how many hundreds there were of us.&nbsp; We seemed like
a city-full in ourselves.&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;ll believe me,
at the same time, on the other side of the dock, another great
steamer was unloading.&nbsp; So that <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>presently we were all
mixed&mdash;all mixed and scattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Azalea, guessing now what was
coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I lost David,&rdquo; whispered Mary Cecily; &ldquo;I
lost my little brother.&nbsp; His hand slipped from mine and I
could not find him.&nbsp; I looked for him all that day; I asked
everybody, and no one could tell me anything about him.&nbsp; At
night a policeman took me away and put me in the house of a woman
and told me to sleep and he would look.&nbsp; So I stayed in the
house that night, and the next day I began searching again; and
the policeman had others looking.&nbsp; But we never found him,
any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never found him at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never at all.&nbsp; My uncle came on, after I had
written him, and he searched.&nbsp; But it was no use.&nbsp;
David was never found; and they concluded at last that he had
been pushed from the wharf into the water and drowned.&nbsp; But
I said no.&nbsp; I could hear him calling for me in the night the
way the dead never call.&nbsp; I could feel him somewhere,
drawing me, drawing me, but I could not tell which way to go, or
I would have run to him across the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;Of course you would&mdash;of
course.&rdquo;&nbsp; Azalea drew nearer till she could rest her
hand on Mary Cecily&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we never found him,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So after a while we left the city, my uncle and I, and
went to the little farm he had in Maryland.&nbsp; He was
something of a writer too, like my father; and he published a
little weekly paper.&nbsp; So you see it was an interesting home
he had brought me to.&nbsp; His wife was one of those women who
are well pleased to have a motherless child to add to her
own.&nbsp; She was kind to me but she didn&rsquo;t spoil me
because I was bounden to her.&nbsp; She set me my tasks and saw
to it that I did them, and when I was a grown girl and showed a
little talent for writing I was sent to my uncle&rsquo;s office
to help with the making of his paper and setting of it up.&nbsp;
He drilled me in writing and he taught me type-setting, and I was
content there.&nbsp; I never wanted to take up any life of my
own.&nbsp; I wanted to be left to myself to mourn for
David&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but there was nothing in that,&rdquo; broke in
Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it?&nbsp; But sorrow is like
sickness and it can cloud the spirits as sickness <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>weakens the
body.&nbsp; But for being kept so busy by my wise relatives, I
should have lost my mind altogether, I make no doubt.&nbsp; But
they were a large family, and there was teasing and laughing and
tricks going on as well as work, and that was my medicine.&nbsp;
But even with all that, I was forever looking down the road,
thinking one of those New York detectives would be bringing my
little brother back to me.&nbsp; Whenever the letters came I sat
frozen with hope that wouldn&rsquo;t be hope, till they were
given out.&nbsp; I kept thinking that one would be handed to me
that would tell me David was found.&nbsp; But none ever
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you grew happier after a time,&rdquo; protested
Azalea, who could not long endure the thought of sorrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must have!&nbsp; See how happy everything is with you
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Mary Cecily, &ldquo;I did grow
happier after a time, though as I say, I didn&rsquo;t really want
to.&nbsp; But I got to be a young woman, and Bryan Rowantree came
along.&nbsp; He was the younger son of a fine English
family&mdash;Irish on his mother&rsquo;s side, however&mdash;and
he came over to America to better himself.&nbsp; He heard of my
uncle&rsquo;s little paper and looked him up, thinking he might
be wanted to lend a hand, but my uncle <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>liked to
run things his own way, quietly and casually, as he used to put
it.&nbsp; So he didn&rsquo;t take the young man into
partnership&mdash;but I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled down at Azalea happily, and the girl could see that
whatever others might think, Rowantree&rsquo;s wife could see
nothing but the advantages of the marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say he was young,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was, however, twelve years older than myself.&nbsp; But I have
always been a poor thing and thankful to have some one to lean
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy me,&rdquo; thought Azalea, &ldquo;can it be she
thinks she&rsquo;s leaning on that man?&nbsp; I thought it was
just the other way.&rdquo;&nbsp; She kept her eyes fixed on the
ground carefully, afraid that if she lifted them her thoughts
would be read in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a sweet little wedding,&rdquo; said Mary Cecily
dreamily, &ldquo;and then we came away together.&nbsp; We had no
particular place to go to, but Bryan said he thought he would
like to wander for a time.&nbsp; That suited me, too.&nbsp; But
after a little we got tired of that.&nbsp; Besides, we saw that
our money would soon give out.&nbsp; So, when we heard of this
woodland up here for sale for almost nothing, we bought it.&nbsp;
The <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Rowantrees were once great landed proprietors, but in
recent years they had been obliged to live in cities, and it had
not suited them.&nbsp; At least, it did not suit my
husband.&nbsp; So here we are.&nbsp; We lead a very peaceful,
retired life.&nbsp; Mr. Rowantree loves quiet, as he said to
you.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve the children if ever I feel the
loneliness stealing on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A call sounded through the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think we&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; smiled Mrs.
Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we must be getting back to the house,
but before we go I want you to promise me that you will not speak
of my sorrow.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a queer way I have with me, not
liking to see sympathy save in the eyes of my own chosen
friends.&nbsp; Come now, and I hope and pray Miss Pace will not
accuse me of rudeness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Zillah?&nbsp; Never!&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful story you&rsquo;ve told me, Mrs.
Rowantree&mdash;so sad I can hardly believe it&mdash;much sadder
than mine, and that is sad enough.&nbsp; Not that I feel
sad,&rdquo; she added hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since I became a
McBirney I&rsquo;m a very happy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not really a McBirney, are you?&nbsp;
Those good mountain people haven&rsquo;t really adopted
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&ldquo;Not by law, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; smiled
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what does that matter if we love each
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have Miss Carin and her parents for your
friends.&nbsp; That must be a great comfort to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, they&rsquo;re like flowers in the garden of
the world,&rdquo; cried Azalea with one of her pretty extravagant
speeches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I believe it, my dear.&nbsp; Yes, we are
coming,&rdquo; she called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you think I had
locked this dryad up in an oak tree?&rdquo; she asked playfully,
her arm about Azalea, as they came up to the gallery.&nbsp; Her
husband threw a quick glance at her.&nbsp; He knew how to read
the changes on her emotional face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut,&rdquo; he said under his breath to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;David again!&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t,
mavourneen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a treasure, Bryan,&rdquo; his wife
whispered, indicating Azalea with a little nod of the head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It never could do any harm to ease my heart to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Pace thinks they must all be on their way, Mary
Cecily,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have the horses
brought &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have a taste of tea before you start,&rdquo;
pleaded Mrs. Rowantree.&nbsp; But Aunt Zillah as <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>politely
declined.&nbsp; So, presently, Zillah Pace and her three young
people rode quietly beneath the lengthening shadows through the
sweet smelling woodland to their home.&nbsp; This time, Aunt
Zillah and Carin rode together, and Azalea&rsquo;s pony tried in
vain to keep pace with Keefe&rsquo;s raw-boned horse.&nbsp; Keefe
had much to say of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very happy the little time I stayed there at
Rowantree Hall,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I understood their
ways&mdash;understood the things they do and the things they
don&rsquo;t do&mdash;and what&rsquo;s more I perfectly understand
why they don&rsquo;t do them.&nbsp; Rowantree himself amuses me,
yet I&rsquo;m fond of him.&nbsp; Mrs. Rowantree&mdash;well,
she&rsquo;s a little miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is,&rdquo; cried Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;How she
works&mdash;and doesn&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; What ducks the children
are!&nbsp; And how contented they all seem in that
solitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be Highland chieftains,&rdquo; laughed
Keefe.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how do you suppose they live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; Azalea admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does he farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little&mdash;a very little.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s she who
thinks out the things that keep the wolf from the door.&nbsp; <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>To be sure
he has a little money coming from England now and then; but
it&rsquo;s Mrs. Rowantree with her little movable sawmill, which
she pays men to run, who really keeps the flour in the
barrel.&nbsp; Then she raises chickens, has a cow or two, a
vegetable patch and all that.&nbsp; But best of all, she knows
how to do without and yet be happy, and she&rsquo;s bringing up
the children in the same way.&nbsp; You noticed, they never
apologized for a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing!&nbsp; I liked that, Keefe.&nbsp; She knew
we wouldn&rsquo;t care how things were.&nbsp; All we wanted was
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right.&nbsp; All we wanted was
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sighed sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
makes one feel at home, doesn&rsquo;t she, that little Mary
Cecily Rowantree?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a lonely cub, Miss
Azalea&mdash;a queer lonely cub&mdash;thrown out of the lair by
an accident, and not knowing much about home.&nbsp; But she does
something to me&mdash;makes me feel as if I&rsquo;d got
back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated for a long time.&nbsp; At last Azalea prodded him
with a &ldquo;Got back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not answer.&nbsp; They rode on then in the noisy
silence of the woods, rode to the sound of falling water, the
call of sleepy birds, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the almost inaudible rustle of the
trees and the little sharp cries of insects.&nbsp; Keefe saw the
ladies to their door but he would not come in with them.&nbsp; He
left them, to go to his tent and to boil his own tea in the
little iron kettle, which, swung from his tripod, had served him
on many expeditions.&nbsp; He had placed his tent not far from
the rim of a precipice, though back among trees where it would be
protected from storms.&nbsp; But to-night he abandoned their
shelter, and sat quite on the rim itself, letting the rolling
earth fill him with wonder.&nbsp; The stars swept by, a young
sickle moon arose, the world faded from rosy gray to purple, from
purple to the soft starlit gloom of a summer night.&nbsp; And
still he sat there, dreaming, wondering, planning, longing.</p>
<p>Most of all he wondered why it was that there were so few
thoughts really worth thinking which one could put into
words.</p>
<h2><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;DOING GOOD&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The little silvery shower which had helped to make Sunday
charming, sent along a number of less agreeable members of its
family the following day.&nbsp; Azalea and Carin opened their
eyes upon a rain-smitten landscape, and down the chimney blew a
damp wind.&nbsp; It made a failure of breakfast, for the kitchen
stove absolutely refused to draw, and it sent the girls out
finally in a pelting shower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are foolish to go,&rdquo; Miss Zillah told them,
really quite out of patience with them for the first time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There will be no pupils at the school to-day.&nbsp; You
might much better stay at home and keep dry.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
think that your parents would approve of your going out in such a
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was the use of having rubber boots and raincoats and
rubber caps and umbrellas, if they were not to be used?&nbsp; So
the girls argued till they finally won Miss Zillah&rsquo;s
consent.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>It
really was rather a lark to be out in a buffeting storm like
that.&nbsp; They could hardly see for the downpour, but they ran
on, heads lowered, skirts gathered close, and were presently in
the little schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to light the lamps,&rdquo; said
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a soul could see to study in this place
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remind me of Ma McBirney,&rdquo; said Carin, wiping
the rain from her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your first thought is always
to make the room bright.&nbsp; Now me, I think of myself
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea took off her dripping coat, removed the rubber boots
from her slippered feet, released her head from its cap and
looked about her, shivering a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
old days when my own mamma and I were wanderers, going from place
to place with that terrible show, we were often so cold and
wretched that no words could describe it.&nbsp; Yet mamma always
tried to make some sort of a little cosy spot for me&mdash;some
sort of a nest that I could get into.&nbsp; It might only be a
ragged comfortable in a corner of the wagon; or it might be a
place under a tree near the camp <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>fire.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t seem to
care how she got along, if only she could make me happy.&nbsp; I
realize now how often she went without food to feed me well, and
how she gave me the best of everything.&nbsp; I was told about
that by poor old Betty Bowen that time Sisson kidnapped
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk about that, Azalea,&rdquo; cried
her friend, throwing her arms about her and kissing her on the
cheek with a sort of desperate tenderness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t bear it.&nbsp; Oh, those nights that we didn&rsquo;t
know where you were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only speak of it,&rdquo; said Azalea, holding her
friend close to her, &ldquo;because that explains why I want to
make every place cheerful.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stand gloom and
chill and hunger&mdash;can&rsquo;t stand them for myself or
anyone else.&nbsp; And then&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh at me, Carin,
please&mdash;there&rsquo;s another reason.&nbsp; I want to pass
on to others all the goodness that has been done to me these last
lovely months.&nbsp; Oh, Carin, I want to do good the way your
father and mother do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to give up my whole
life to it.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;ve really no family.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m very queerly placed in life.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s gentle
blood in me, and restless blood.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m different from
Ma and Pa McBirney and dear Jim.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get around
that, can I?&nbsp; <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>No matter how much I love them, no matter how long we
live together, I&rsquo;ll always be different.&nbsp; Yet, on the
other hand, I&rsquo;ll not know the sort of people that Colonel
Atherton&rsquo;s granddaughter would be expected to know.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll not come into my life.&nbsp; I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
expect to marry&mdash;when I grow up&mdash;the sort
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried Carin impetuously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry whoever you wish.&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;ll meet all sorts of people at my house&mdash;people
who will appreciate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Azalea shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my lot has been cast in
with that of simple folk.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad of it, mind you,
and proud to be loved by Mother McBirney.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
sweetest thing that ever happened to me.&nbsp; But all the same,
I think I shall have to choose some sort of a career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she talked, she tidied the schoolroom, lighted the lamps,
and ventured on a little blaze in the fireplace to send away the
chill.&nbsp; Carin, less used to such services, sat fascinatedly
watching her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A career!&rdquo; she sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Azalea,
what do you mean by that?&nbsp; Of course I believe girls should
have careers,&rdquo; she added hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>want to be
an artist myself, and if that old dairy doesn&rsquo;t use up
every ounce of Annie Laurie&rsquo;s energy, I suppose
she&rsquo;ll be a singer.&nbsp; Anyway, she could be, if she
chose.&nbsp; But what would you do, Zalie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just do good,&rdquo; said Azalea simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t earn a living for you.&nbsp;
Weren&rsquo;t you thinking of earning a living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be
a great living to have people coming to you for help and to know
you could drive the misery out of them&mdash;and the devils out
of them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the money&mdash;&rdquo; continued Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be enough, probably,&rdquo; said Azalea,
still not willing to give attention to that part of the
subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel, Carin, that somehow there would be
money enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the schoolhouse door blew open with a sweep of
rain-laden wind and it took the combined strength of the two
girls to close it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Zillah was quite right,&rdquo; said Carin
breathlessly after this was accomplished.&nbsp; &ldquo;We ought
never to have come, Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Azalea, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some one
trying to get in, Carin.&nbsp; Did you bolt the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t stay shut
otherwise.&nbsp; Help me open it, Azalea.&nbsp; The bolt
sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came back so suddenly at last that Azalea almost lost her
footing, and the next moment, half-blinded by the storm, her poor
garments soaked and dripping, her blouse held together by her
single hand, Paralee Panther stood in the room.&nbsp; If she had
been sullen on other days, she was tragic now.&nbsp; So
storm-beaten in body and in spirit was she, that she looked as if
all the world was her foe.&nbsp; Indeed, she always seemed to be
thinking that, and now as she stood there, frowning from under
her dripping hair, the gentle girls at whom she glowered fairly
shrank from her.</p>
<p>Then Azalea remembered, as by a swift light of the spirit, how
misfortune could make one misrepresent one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp;
She thought of herself as she had been in the old days, when,
dust-stained, weary, hungry, shy and often resentful, she had
slunk along beside the wagons of Sisson&rsquo;s All Star Show,
and of how in reality she had been the same as she was now,
friendly and good, loving cleanliness and beauty and all
seemliness.</p>
<p>She went forward to the girl and seized her hand.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&ldquo;Oh, Paralee,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so glad now that we came.&nbsp; Miss Pace thought no one would be
here; but you started, I suppose, before the storm began.&nbsp;
Come to the fire, do.&nbsp; We can take off your dress and hang
it on the chair backs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she had made a mistake.&nbsp; The girl drew back, her eyes
full of that hurt, animal-like anger which was almost always
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take off my dress,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
Azalea guessed why&mdash;that she would not have them see her
makeshifts for underclothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be better not,&rdquo; Azalea said, as
if having thought the matter over, she reached the same
conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to the fire, then.&nbsp; You will
soon dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away to give the girl a chance to make herself
comfortable in her own manner, and lighted the alcohol stove
beneath the shining brass teakettle.&nbsp; She and Carin kept a
little store of supplies at school&mdash;dainties designed to
help out their light luncheons&mdash;and now she made a selection
from these, and spreading a tray daintily, put it before
Paralee.&nbsp; There was the steaming tea, crackers, cookies,
cheese, and candied ginger.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;Such a queer little meal,&rdquo; she laughed
apologetically, &ldquo;but it will help to get the damp out of
you.&nbsp; You must feel quite like a sponge, Paralee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up from under her heavy brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a sponge?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Carin heard Azalea stammeringly trying to make clear to her
pupil the nature of a sponge, and discreetly withdrew to the most
distant part of the schoolroom and began busying herself by
making a sketch of the storm-tossed trees in the wild purple
light.&nbsp; She heard Azalea&rsquo;s voice going on and on,
kindly, gently, insistently; heard Paralee&rsquo;s gruff answers;
but the rain and the wind drowned the words.&nbsp; It was only
when Azalea called to her that she learned of the nature of the
conversation.&nbsp; Paralee was standing with half dried garments
before the fire.&nbsp; She had eaten her little repast, and with
her one poor hand was brushing back the hair that straggled about
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paralee,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;wants to be a
teacher, Carin.&nbsp; She has to make her own living, and that is
the way she means to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a gleam of Azalea&rsquo;s eye, not the barest <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>flicker of
the voice, told that she thought such an ambition
outrageous.&nbsp; The heavy-faced, half-clothed child, so dark
and hateful, so ugly and suspicious, might have been the
embodiment of light for all that Azalea&rsquo;s manner
betrayed.&nbsp; Once more Carin&rsquo;s affectionate appreciation
of her friend went out in swift response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; asked Carin in the same friendly
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll teach her what we know, and
then she can go to some one better fitted to make a teacher of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could see the girl peering up furtively from under her
hair, wondering if it could be possible that they believed in
her.&nbsp; No one ever had.&nbsp; But obstinately, passionately,
in the face of all things, she believed in herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do nothing else,&rdquo; she said in her
deep voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got but one
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lost the other,&rdquo; said Azalea in her even,
pleasant voice, &ldquo;when she was trying to shoot rabbits for
the family to eat.&nbsp; She and her grandmother have come down
with her brother while he works at the sawmill Mrs. Rowantree has
set up on the Ravenel Branch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come &rsquo;less I did, too,&rdquo;
explained Paralee.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t like to leave
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>What
could the home be that the brother of this girl would hate to
leave, Carin wondered.&nbsp; It seemed as if Paralee must have
come out of a cave rather than a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Panthers has always lived by ourselves,&rdquo; the
girl said in half angry explanation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jake
hain&rsquo;t used to talking to strange folks.&nbsp; And he
didn&rsquo;t have no proper clothes for leaving home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Panther is a strange name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are there many families of your name in these
mountains, Paralee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hain&rsquo;t our name,&rdquo; returned the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our name&rsquo;s Marr.&nbsp; My granddad was a
fighter, he was.&nbsp; He kilt six men.&nbsp; It was a war.&nbsp;
They called him the Panther of Soco River.&nbsp; Then they called
us all Panthers.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; she added
defiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;One name suits us as well as
t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father,&rdquo; explained Azalea, &ldquo;is
paralyzed from a tree having fallen on him.&nbsp; His home is
away out on the tongue of the Soco mountain&mdash;so far away it
can only be reached by &lsquo;nag travel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Paralee
says no doctor ever goes to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; said Paralee, &ldquo;for two years nobody
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>come up
the road, and we didn&rsquo;t go nowhere.&nbsp; For two whole
years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls let the words rest on the air for a moment, taking
in their meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in heaven&rsquo;s name do you live?&rdquo; asked
Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live &rsquo;cause we don&rsquo;t die.&nbsp; We git
up and go to bed,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;It gits so
still up there we stop talking.&nbsp; Why, we &rsquo;most forget
the way to say words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what do you have to eat?&nbsp; How do you make
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need no money.&nbsp; Not much,
anyhow.&nbsp; We raise some corn and two or three hogs; and we
have some chickens and a garden patch.&nbsp; Ma does some
weaving.&nbsp; Pa used to hunt.&nbsp; Then, when he got hurt, I
tried hunting.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked down at her maimed
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she said
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Panthers is well named.&nbsp; They
just live up a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave a short, sharp
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ever did your brother and you come to leave
home?&rdquo; demanded Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they need
you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needed us terrible.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t do work
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>to
&rsquo;mount to nothing, and Jake was just hanging &rsquo;round
doing chores Pete could do as well.&nbsp; I goaded Jake on to
coming down to the sawmill.&nbsp; I thought he might get some
comforts for pa.&nbsp; And grandma, she&rsquo;d got so mean and
worried ma so, I got her to come along.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused
for a moment, and then gave way to an outbreak of rage and
misery.&nbsp; &ldquo;We was getting to be like stumps,&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we was getting
like&mdash;just like the stumps out in the clearing.&nbsp; You
couldn&rsquo;t tell we was humans.&nbsp; I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
stand it no longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she stood facing them in her
ugliness and wretchedness, with her great mass of hair hanging
about her half-bare shoulders, she seemed to be mysteriously
redeemed from mere brutishness by this rebellion.&nbsp; Out of
that sodden silence and poverty, that shame of inaction, her
protest and purpose had sprung into life.&nbsp; For a moment the
girls were silent with sympathy.&nbsp; Then Azalea said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll teach you, Paralee, early and late.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll help you in every way we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will,&rdquo; agreed Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we
can do so much more than you think, Paralee.&nbsp;
Paralee?&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such an unusual
name.&nbsp; Is it a&mdash;a family name?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Paralee Panther gave a curious shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said with an accent of disgust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t a name any more than Panther.&nbsp; They
didn&rsquo;t name me at all&mdash;called me Babe.&nbsp; When I
was six, I got tired of it.&nbsp; I wanted a name&mdash;cried for
a name&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t seem to think of none.&nbsp; I
invented that name&mdash;Paralee.&nbsp; I thought it awful pretty
then.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think so now,&rdquo; she added
bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a fool name.&nbsp; I
wish my name was anything else&mdash;anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a middle name that I don&rsquo;t need,&rdquo;
said Carin with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Louisa.&nbsp;
Now, what if I should give that to you?&nbsp; &lsquo;Louisa
Marr!&rsquo;&nbsp; How would that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Summers is coming up to see us by and by,&rdquo;
said Azalea, taking hold of Paralee&rsquo;s arm with a girlish
squeeze, &ldquo;and he can name you properly.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
Methodist preacher.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paralee nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once he came to
see my pa.&nbsp; He said if pa could be got to an X-ray, or an
X-ray could be got to him, maybe he&rsquo;d be cured.&nbsp; But
it was just talk.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t do nothing,&rdquo; she
added with a return to her old bitterness.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;Probably he couldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo;
said Azalea, swift to defend the husband of her own
&ldquo;pretend cousin,&rdquo; Barbara Summers, whom she had
picked out of all the world to be her &ldquo;kin&rdquo; since she
had none of her own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Summers is poor, too, and
there are many people that he must do things for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t do nothing for us,&rdquo; said
the girl.&nbsp; Then she brooded for a moment in her heavy
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we didn&rsquo;t do nothing for
ourselves,&rdquo; she broke out.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was what made
me mad&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t do nothing for ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your folks didn&rsquo;t know how,&rdquo; said
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was it&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t know
how.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t help themselves any more than if
they had been children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they are,&rdquo; the girl
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re children&mdash;they don&rsquo;t
know nothing.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t <i>do</i> nothing.&nbsp; Oh,
it&rsquo;s so awful&mdash;not to have things to eat; to be like
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; She held out her stump of a hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To be like dad&mdash;not able to move!&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t
it a curse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be changed,&rdquo; said Carin decidedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It can be and it shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the mountain girl
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>with a
return of despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Braid your hair, Paralee,&rdquo; commanded
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have a lesson.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll teach you more this morning than you ever learned in
any one lesson in your life.&nbsp; I noticed last week that you
knew how to study better than anyone in the school.&nbsp; You
could keep your mind on a thing, and that&rsquo;s much more than
half the battle.&nbsp; Oh, we&rsquo;ll make a teacher of you,
never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So all that long day of wild wind and rain, Azalea labored
with her pupil.&nbsp; Hitherto, teaching had been a pleasant if
tiring experience.&nbsp; Azalea had felt a cheerful zest in
passing on her ideas and her good practical knowledge.&nbsp; But
this morning a holy passion for teaching came to her.&nbsp; She
poured facts into Paralee&rsquo;s starved mind with the same deep
satisfaction that she would have given her water had she been
perishing of thirst.&nbsp; No other pupils came.&nbsp; Carin,
sitting apart, silent and content with her own occupations, did
not interrupt them, and the mountain girl listened to her ardent
young teacher, conned her lessons untiringly, and throughout the
long hours of the school day refused to rest.&nbsp; It was as if
she had come into <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>the house of her own mind; as if she had opened up the
weed-choked door and crossed the threshold, discovering within
fair rooms undreamed of; as if she had put the shutters back from
long-closed windows and let the light stream in.</p>
<p>By four o&rsquo;clock the rain seemed to have beaten itself
out, and the wind died, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Study is over!&rdquo; cried Azalea at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, Paralee, get your things.&nbsp; Such a day!&nbsp; I
tell you, anyone who can study as you do will make a
success.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it so, Carin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin got up from her letter writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
have been writing some letters that ought to help on.&nbsp; You
must go away to school, Paralee.&nbsp; There are boarding
schools&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would they do me?&rdquo; demanded the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could I pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have money to be used for such things as that,&rdquo;
Carin said gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father gave it to me.&nbsp; I
would love to use it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I give you back, then?&nbsp; When us
Panthers has presents give to us, we pay back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not thought yet,&rdquo; said Carin seriously, <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>&ldquo;but
I will think.&nbsp; I will let you pay me back.&nbsp; Please,
please, don&rsquo;t think about that now.&nbsp; Only
study&mdash;study&mdash;study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you didn&rsquo;t have to go home
to-night,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you
stay with us?&nbsp; A six mile walk over gullies like those out
there in the yard doesn&rsquo;t seem a pleasant
prospect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain girl looked at her almost with pity&mdash;as if
for once she understood something which her instructress did
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ll mind gullies?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed Azalea; &ldquo;no, I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paralee Panther had worn neither jacket nor hat, and in her
thin blouse and short skirt, bare-footed, her great braids, half
undone, straggling down her back, she swung off down her mountain
trail.&nbsp; Her heavy, awkward body gave the impression of great
strength and for all of her awkwardness, whoever looked at her
felt that she would be brave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best day&rsquo;s work we&rsquo;ve done
yet,&rdquo; said Azalea at last, turning rather wearily to find
her things.&nbsp; But Carin had them ready for her, and when the
schoolhouse was locked, the two friends made their way single
file beneath the dripping branches and across the noisy brook, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>thankful
for their good rubber boots and coats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think where Keefe has been to-day,&rdquo;
said Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is just the sort of a day you&rsquo;d
have expected him to come.&nbsp; We might have needed him, if the
storm had grown worse.&nbsp; Weren&rsquo;t you surprised that he
didn&rsquo;t look in on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was,&rdquo; confessed Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t like him to stay away on a stormy day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin laughed&mdash;and her laugh had a touch of vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it wasn&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo; she
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know very little about him,
really.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t go on your impressions too much,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; confessed Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everyone
tells me that.&nbsp; Pa McBirney is forever saying it.&nbsp; Just
the same I know it wasn&rsquo;t like Keefe to stay away on a
stormy day like this and I&rsquo;d feel better if I knew where he
was this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They should have been in sight of the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest by
this time, but the clouds, which had lifted for a time, were
settling down again in white drifting masses.&nbsp; They had not,
of course, been able to see the mountain peaks all day; but now
the trees began to disappear as if willed out <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>of
existence by some wonderful necromancer; then their very pathway
before them seemed swallowed up; and finally each looked to the
other like a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, but it is uncanny!&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we haven&rsquo;t far to go.&nbsp; We could
get lost in our own doorway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that they heard the cheering whistle of Keefe
O&rsquo;Connor.&nbsp; It came, apparently, from the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been with Aunt Zillah,&rdquo; said Azalea
with a little sigh of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was nice of him,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; A day like this she&rsquo;s sure to be
lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a blithe answer to the whistle, and seizing
Carin&rsquo;s hand, ran on swift feet to the cottage, laughing as
the billowing mist parted and then closed like water behind
her.&nbsp; The little cabin could not be discerned till she and
Carin were fairly upon it.&nbsp; Then they saw the dull glow of a
light in the window, and groping for the door, found the handle
just at the moment Keefe opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are, Miss Pace,&rdquo; he called,
&ldquo;quite safe and sound.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve looked in at you
several <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>times to-day, if you want to know, but I thought my
room was better than my company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home,&rdquo;
cried Aunt Zillah, helping them off with their things.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I declare, it&rsquo;s getting darker every minute.&nbsp;
Why, the mist isn&rsquo;t white any more&mdash;it&rsquo;s
black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the heart of a black cloud, that&rsquo;s
why,&rdquo; said Keefe cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve
wood and oil and food inside, so what do we care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been working around the place all
day,&rdquo; said Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I must say I was
glad to have him take a hand.&nbsp; Mr. McEvoy is an excellent
man, but he certainly does carry his &lsquo;take-it-easy&rsquo;
philosophy to extremes.&nbsp; But even he is a comfort.&nbsp; In
my opinion, every house needs a man around it to make it look
right.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WAR</span></h2>
<p>Well, but it was a snug little cabin!&nbsp; The mist-wraiths
might drift by the window, might even pause to thrust their
spectral faces against the pane, but it mattered nothing to those
who were safe and snug within.&nbsp; Aunt Zillah cooked her
special stew for supper, and served it with potatoes baked in the
coals, raised biscuit, and honey and dainties for dessert.&nbsp;
Keefe had brought out his borrowed guitar and kept the room
ringing with his melodies.&nbsp; The girls saw that the occasion
was to be a festive one, and put on the brightest frocks they
could find in their trunks.</p>
<p>Then, with the fire leaping and the candles and lamps lighted
and supper laid out with the pink dishes and the white doilies,
the place was charming indeed.&nbsp; To Miss Zillah, for the
first time in her life removed from oversight of her elder
sister, and playing at being the mother of a family, it was an
experience that made her <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>shy, middle-aged heart leap within
her.&nbsp; To Carin, used to luxury and beauty and her
parent&rsquo;s unceasing care, it was an adventure in
independence; to Azalea, accustomed to changes, to people of many
sorts, to both rough and smooth living, it was one more chapter
in a book destined to be filled with curious incidents.&nbsp; To
Keefe&mdash;but let him speak for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;looks to me
singularly like Paradise.&nbsp; My own particular habitation is
as damp and cold as the Mammoth Cave.&nbsp; My bed is done up in
oilskins, and my easel is under the bed.&nbsp; Every stick of
wood I have is drenched, and the field mice have got at my
food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor orphan,&rdquo; laughed Carin, and then stopped on
the word, wondering if she had not spoken the truth concerning
him.&nbsp; He had told nothing of himself, save that he hoped to
be an artist, and that he already had studied at the New York
Academy of Design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he retorted, giving no heed to her
embarrassment, &ldquo;I congratulated myself when I borrowed that
tent from Mr. Rowantree.&nbsp; I saw it wouldn&rsquo;t keep water
out.&nbsp; I said to myself, <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>&lsquo;The first time we have a
downpour I&rsquo;ll have to take refuge with the nearest
neighbor.&rsquo;&nbsp; I saw to it that you were that
neighbor.&nbsp; To-night, of course, I shall put in an
application for the guest chamber at Mis&rsquo; Cassie
McEvoy&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll sleep in the room with the
medicine-bottle decoration, but until the clock tells me it is
really night, here I stay.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I, Miss
Pace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you do,&rdquo; she returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
laborer is worthy of his hire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had got over the slight prejudice she felt against him at
first meeting.&nbsp; He was too obliging, too amiable, too
wistful, for her to keep him at a distance.&nbsp; Miss
Zillah&rsquo;s heart was a particularly soft one, though for
conscience sake she could be stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you had only one pupil to-day,&rdquo; she said
to the girls when they were seated at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she underwent a curious transformation,&rdquo; said
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;She came to us Paralee Panther.&nbsp; She
went away Louisa Marr.&nbsp; Of course we can&rsquo;t call her
that just yet, as people wouldn&rsquo;t know whom we were talking
about.&nbsp; But when she goes away to school, as I mean she
shall, she&rsquo;ll bear a proper Christian name.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Between Azalea and Carin the grim story of the
Panther&rsquo;s life was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; concluded Azalea, &ldquo;my heart is
set on rescuing that poor Mr. Panther.&nbsp; Why, it will be like
bringing a man from a mine&mdash;or taking him from the
Bastille.&nbsp; Oh, we mustn&rsquo;t wait.&nbsp; We must set
about the rescue at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so easy as you imagine,&rdquo; said
Miss Zillah, with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;When people get away down
like that, they don&rsquo;t seem to want to be disturbed.&nbsp;
They enjoy their misery.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t be surprised if
after you get to the poor man, you find him quite unwilling to
let you do anything for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t even think of such a thing as
that,&rdquo; cried Azalea, with her usual impatience at the
mention of obstacles.&nbsp; &ldquo;When can we go to him,
Keefe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before Saturday, of course.&nbsp; We ought to take
a physician with us, oughtn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we ought,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Carin, couldn&rsquo;t we telegraph back home and get
Doctor Stevenson to come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they wrote out a telegram which was sent to Bee Tree the
following day and from there telephoned to the nearest telegraph
station.&nbsp; But <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>to their disappointment they received the reply from
Dr. Stevenson that he had a very critical case in hand which he
could not leave.&nbsp; Carin wired elsewhere, but without
success, and they were on the point of postponing the visit when,
on Friday, there dawned upon their view the familiar figure of
Haystack Thompson, their old friend with the fiddle.&nbsp; With
his &ldquo;haystack&rdquo; mop of hair in wilder confusion than
ever&mdash;for it had grown grayer and more wiry every
month&mdash;with his kind, keen, rolling eyes looking
extraordinarily large, and his spare frame thinned, as it seemed,
to the very bone, he appeared at the schoolhouse just before
closing, and the moment Azalea&rsquo;s eyes fell on him, she felt
that he was the person to help them out.&nbsp; Just how he would
do it she did not stop to think, but ever since she had known him
she had counted on his power to help.</p>
<p>He was lending his aid to some one at that moment evidently,
for by the hand he led a small boy whom neither Carin nor Azalea
had seen before, but the moment that Azalea noticed Bud Coulter
starting from his seat, she knew the newcomer for Skully Simms,
the nephew of the Coulters&rsquo; hereditary enemy, and the boy
who <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>had
on several occasions peeped in at the windows of the schoolroom
which he dared not enter.</p>
<p>All week things had gone moderately well.&nbsp; The school now
had twenty-four pupils, one of them a girl older than her
teachers, another a married woman, Mrs. McIntosh, who, having
brought her painfully shy little daughter to school had been
obliged to stay with her.&nbsp; Mrs. McIntosh had at first meant
only to look on, but the example set by the children had been too
much for her, and she was now conning her first reader beside an
eight year old girl.&nbsp; Azalea and Carin had almost ceased
looking for trouble, and it was with a sharp shock of alarm that
they saw Bud Coulter spring to his feet and shake a hard young
fist in the direction of the quivering Skully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Simms can&rsquo;t come to this here school while
I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You git out
o&rsquo; here, Skully Simms, you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simms cast one glance behind him as if for flight, but the
firm hand of his friend Haystack Thompson upon his shoulder held
him; then the second glance made him aware of all the children
rising from their seats, of the flaming <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>eyes and
distorted mouth of Bud Coulter, and the next moment all of his
fears vanished in a flare of the old inherited hate.&nbsp; He
drew in his breath sharply through his teeth, leaped forward, all
bunched up like an animal, and the next thing that anybody knew,
the two boys were struggling together in the center of the
schoolroom.</p>
<p>The fiddler might have managed these two boys, but he saw in a
moment that he would have trouble coping with what was likely to
follow.&nbsp; For generations the neighbors who bore the names of
the children within that school had taken sides in the long and
dark struggle between the Simms and the Coulters, and now, in a
flash, all their old loyalty to the &ldquo;mean fighters&rdquo;
of their mountain was upon them.&nbsp; They leaped to their feet,
got from the floor on to the seats, shrieking and stamping to
cheer on their favorites.&nbsp; It was not a
&ldquo;scrap.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a war&mdash;an old war&mdash;in
which men of both names had fallen, and for which they all
thought it honorable to fight to the finish.</p>
<p>Azalea, sitting stark still at her desk, saw, with
wide-stretched eyes, her peaceful schoolroom turned into
something resembling a cave <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of angry wildcats.&nbsp; Moreover,
she knew enough about such quarrels to imagine what the outcome
might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carin,&rdquo; she shrilled to her friend who had turned
from the blackboard and stood paralyzed at what she beheld,
&ldquo;we must think&mdash;we must <i>think</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was little time for thinking.&nbsp; They could see
that in a few moments more every boy in the room would be at the
throat of some other boy, all for the glory of the old war cries:
&ldquo;Coulter!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Simms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, as Azalea was discovering how unlikely her
&ldquo;thinking&rdquo; was to be of any use, an extraordinary
sound smote her ears.&nbsp; It rolled out like thunder, it came
in volleys like pistol shots, it was so strange, so loud, so
mocking, that all save the fight-crazed boys at grips on the
floor turned to see what it was.</p>
<p>And what they saw was Haystack Thompson laughing!</p>
<p>He was leaning against the door post and he was laughing as if
he were Jove and could find nothing half so amusing as the capers
of earth-men.&nbsp; He laughed on and on, more and more
mockingly, more and more terribly.&nbsp; His mirth <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>was an
insult to those who were engaged in that senseless combat.&nbsp;
It held them in contempt; it made nothing of them.&nbsp; The
children, amazed, fixed their eyes on him.&nbsp; They did not
like that laughter.&nbsp; It raged and roared at their ancient
mountain quarrel; it put them among the fools of the world.&nbsp;
Their anger turned from each other to the man.&nbsp; They forgot
the writhing boys upon the floor, and drew towards Haystack
Thompson, resentment in their faces.</p>
<p>Just then, they were given another surprise.&nbsp; Azalea had
at last thought to some purpose.&nbsp; No one saw her save Carin,
as she took the full water pail from the bench and advanced with
it toward these last silly clansmen of the Simms and Coulters;
but Carin, quick to catch the idea, seized a second pail, and a
moment later a deluge of water descended upon the fighters, and
two gasping, strangling boys, their grip relaxed, lay upon the
floor.</p>
<p>Haystack Thompson was a quick-witted ally.&nbsp; He bounded
forward and grasping Coulter by the shirt collar&mdash;a stout
shirt it was, made of home-spun&mdash;plumped him down in a seat,
then seeing him still in the throes of strangulation, proceeded
to pound him lustily on the <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>back.&nbsp; Azalea, meantime, had
pulled the smaller boy to his feet.&nbsp; He was bleeding at the
nose; one eye was closed and he was blubbering and choking.&nbsp;
She wiped his face with a firm and determined hand, and led him
to the front of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for more water,&rdquo; she commanded, finding that
the blood still spurted from the poor injured nose.&nbsp; The
children held back sullenly, but Paralee Panther picked up a pail
and went to do her bidding.&nbsp; The fiddler&rsquo;s fearful
laughter having ceased, a strange, shamed quiet hung over the
room, broken only by the angry snortings and sobbing of the two
fighters.&nbsp; And then the fiddler began to laugh again, but
not in the old way.&nbsp; This time he laughed as if at the
funniest joke that man ever heard.&nbsp; He began gently, like
one amused, he went on to heights of wild and reckless mirth
which reduced the children, and Azalea and Carin with them, to
helpless, suffering spasms of laughter.&nbsp; There was no
resisting such mirth.&nbsp; It spread like fire, and once alight,
it seemed as if nothing could ever extinguish it.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the wizard released them from the spell.&nbsp;
He stopped and looked about <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>him at his helpless victims.&nbsp;
He shook his head at them sadly as if he regretted their folly,
and drawing faithful &ldquo;Betsy,&rdquo; his fiddle, the one
close friend of his lonely life, from its case, began to
play.&nbsp; It was quiet music, almost like a hymn, and kind
music, like friendship which endures.&nbsp; Paying no attention
to the gasps and gurgles of those he had led into folly, he went
on steadily with his playing.&nbsp; Deep, full and rich were the
chords he played; clear and high and serene was the melody, and
the troubled laughter died before such sounds.&nbsp; Little Simms
with his aching face and humiliated spirit, was struggling to get
the better of his sobs.&nbsp; Coulter, the conqueror, had folded
his arms across his unbuttoned shirt and sat there waiting for
what might happen next.</p>
<p>What happened next was that Haystack Thompson began to
talk.&nbsp; He did not cease playing, but the music that came
from his instrument was as soft as the summer wind in the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something on my mind,&rdquo; he said in
his deep, kind voice, &ldquo;that I want to pass on to
you-all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re young and I&rsquo;m old, and
it&rsquo;s fitting that what I&rsquo;ve learned by living a long
time should be handed on to you, who ain&rsquo;t lived <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>long and
consequently hain&rsquo;t had the chance to make the mistakes I
have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The constitution of the United States says that all men
are born free and equal.&nbsp; Now, in a way that there saying is
true, and in another way it ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
differences in men and in the chances that come to them, that
can&rsquo;t be gainsaid nor got around.&nbsp; But it is true that
all men have an equal right to certain things.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve an equal right to be free, and an equal right to
the good things God made&mdash;to sun and air and water and
food.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve a right to feel happy and a right to be
good.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;ve got a right to
learning&mdash;got a right to know what&rsquo;s hid in books and
in Nature.&nbsp; Anybody who tries to take away these rights from
another is a mean cuss.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s unfitten for other men
to deal with.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got the soul of a wolf, and it
seems like he should be hunted out of the ha&rsquo;nts of
men.&nbsp; Only that wouldn&rsquo;t do, for then we&rsquo;d be
taking away the greatest right of all from him&mdash;the right to
be good.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t make an outlaw of a man and expect
him to be good.&nbsp; No, you&rsquo;ve got to forgive him and
help him&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to show him what his rights are,
what the rights of his neighbors are.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mountain man and my forbears were
mountain men.&nbsp; I know the feelings of folks raised in the
mountains.&nbsp; I know they&rsquo;re brave, and kind to friends
and mean to foes.&nbsp; I know they&rsquo;ve got sense and
patience, and that they&rsquo;ve got folly and madness in them
too.&nbsp; These here quarrels, like the one that broke out a few
minutes ago between these two young bantams&mdash;friends of
mine, both of them, and good bantams&mdash;are a wicked
waste.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what they are.&nbsp; They waste human
lives and human happiness.&nbsp; They make enemies out of folks
that had ought to be friends, and they leave little children
orphans and make our people the laughing stock of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part, I don&rsquo;t wonder that the world laughs
at them.&nbsp; I laugh at them too.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re so behind
the times&mdash;they&rsquo;re so foolish&mdash;so like the wild
animals out there in the mountain.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem to
realize what it is to be men and to stand up fair and square,
taking life and rejoicing, and letting other men take it and
rejoice.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem to understand that hate is
like a disease and that it causes rot at the heart and makes a
man as disgusting as rotten fruit or a sick animal.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t understand <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>it, because they&rsquo;ve grown up
in the blindness and sin of it.&nbsp; Why, I used to feel like
that myself.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t come of a quarreling family,
and us Thompsons had no war of our own, but we took sides with
them that had wars, and I&rsquo;d have been as silly as the rest
of you if I hadn&rsquo;t been taught better by&mdash;&rdquo; he
hesitated and looked about him with a half-shy smile, drew his
bow with thrilling resonance thrice across the deepest strings of
his fiddle, and went on&mdash;&ldquo;by my old fiddle here.&nbsp;
Maybe you&rsquo;ll understand and maybe you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Music has laws.&nbsp; They are laws that run through everything
that&rsquo;s good and true&mdash;they run through the things
you&rsquo;re studying there in your books and they run through
Nature too.&nbsp; They come from God and if we study them right
they help us to know that we&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to study it all out for myself, but I
know what I know.&nbsp; And the grandest thing I know is that
every man has an equal right to his life, to his liberty and to
his learning.&nbsp; You may be friends and you may be foes, but
life and liberty and learning are things that friend and foe have
equal rights to&mdash;equal rights!&nbsp; Think of it
awhile.&nbsp; Think of it as you walk <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>up and down this here mountain
side.&nbsp; Think of it when you go to bed at night.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m an old man&mdash;an old mountain man&mdash;and
you&rsquo;re just as good as my kin, you-all are.&nbsp; And I
tell you, it will be a shame to you what folks will spread over
the whole countryside if you drive these two young ladies away
when they&rsquo;ve given up their ease and their friends for the
whole summer long to come up here to learn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased speaking, but his bow continued its magic movement
back and forth across the strings.&nbsp; For a moment or two he
played a curious melody with sharp, bright notes, like the sparks
from a blazing pine.&nbsp; Then he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skully Simms ain&rsquo;t got no pa; he ain&rsquo;t got
no ma.&nbsp; He lives with his uncle and makes out the best he
can.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s pretty much alone, and it ain&rsquo;t
natural for children to be alone.&nbsp; All the rest of you can
go to homes where there is folks waiting for you.&nbsp; But this
boy has just his uncle.&nbsp; That ain&rsquo;t much like having
your ma and your brothers and sisters and your pa watching out to
see you coming home and speeding you on your way.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s been wanting to come up here to school ever since it
opened.&nbsp; He <i>has</i> come up <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>here and peered in the windows, and
honed to come in.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t durst.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because some of his folks, that perhaps he never so
much as laid eyes on, took a dislike to some of Coulter&rsquo;s
folks, that Coulter never knew.&nbsp; Do you wonder it made me
laugh and mock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He played on, happily.&nbsp; The tune took dancing feet to
itself and set the hearts if not the feet of the children, to a
gay rhythm.&nbsp; Once he lifted the bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wonder?&rdquo; he thundered at them in the
pause.&nbsp; Then he went on with the merry tune.&nbsp; And now,
indeed, the feet of the children began to keep time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Coulter,&rdquo; he cried as if he were calling out
the numbers of a dance, &ldquo;will you cut it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coulter, never a hangdog, sat with his arms still
folded.&nbsp; His blue eyes met the old fiddler&rsquo;s
steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter, you&rsquo;ve got brains.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
not a dolt.&nbsp; You see the point of what I told you.&nbsp; Cut
it out, Coulter, will you, for the sake of these here young
ladies, and for my sake, and for the sake of learning,
Coulter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How happy the music was&mdash;how far away <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>from hate
and meanness and grudging!&nbsp; Coulter looked squarely across
at poor little Simms, who seemed very small and thin.&nbsp; His
spare arms showed through his torn shirt; his wisp of a face was
marred and blackened by Coulter&rsquo;s fist.&nbsp; Suddenly, Bud
Coulter saw the point.&nbsp; Yes,
&ldquo;l&rsquo;arnin&rsquo;&rdquo; was a thing that had neither
to do with friend or foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Coulter?&rdquo; questioned Haystack,
vociferously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; called back Coulter.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he
wants to come to school, I&rsquo;ll keep my hands off
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor bright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&nbsp; When I give my word, I keep
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; shouted Haystack.&nbsp; And
&ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; shouted &ldquo;Betsy,&rdquo; the
violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;School over?&rdquo; queried Haystack.</p>
<p>Azalea nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;School&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; announced the
fiddler.&nbsp; &ldquo;And this is where we march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started down the aisle, his huge head with its wild hair
bent above the violin, and from the little great instrument came
the sounds of marching feet.&nbsp; They were victorious feet;
feet marching in brotherhood; faithful, determined feet.&nbsp;
Falteringly, shyly, the children fell in <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>with
him.&nbsp; It was not, indeed, in human power to resist that
march.&nbsp; Carin, joining with light step, Azalea, marching
more seriously, courage and determination in her face, removed
the last hesitation of the laggards.&nbsp; Skully Simms&rsquo;
tears dried on his swollen face.&nbsp; He got up, half
shame-facedly and fell into the march, and so marching forgot his
shame and his resentment.&nbsp; And Bud Coulter, springing at
last to his feet, tramped with the others.&nbsp; He was, after
all, a &ldquo;good sport.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had spoken out his
feelings, and now, head up&mdash;just a touch defiantly&mdash;he
fell in line.&nbsp; They all went out of the schoolhouse so, and
on to where the various paths diverged, running this way and that
over the mountainside, to end in the little cabins where the
children lived.</p>
<p>Haystack sped them on their way.&nbsp; Then he dropped his
instrument and turned to Azalea who stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, honey-bird,&rdquo; he said with fatherly
tenderness, &ldquo;how does the world treat you?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t many men as inquisitive as I
be,&rdquo; remarked Haystack Thompson as he sat at Aunt
Zillah&rsquo;s supper table that evening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the kind of inquisitiveness that takes
men to big towns, nor the kind that takes men to sea.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s jest the kind that has to know what&rsquo;s going on
in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must admit,&rdquo; said Carin teasingly,
&ldquo;that your neighborhood is rather a large one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, so it is,&rdquo; confessed Mr.
Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;It includes these yere mountains in all
their outcroppings in the two Carolinas.&nbsp; I make it my
business to know what&rsquo;s going on in them whenever
possible.&nbsp; Earthquakes, funerals, singings, weddings, corn
huskings&mdash;anything out of the usual&mdash;demand my
attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad <i>we</i> received it, at any
rate,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you think we were
getting into mischief?&nbsp; The truth is, all had been perfectly
quiet till you arrived on the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&ldquo;But it was a dishonorable peace,&rdquo; roared
Mr. Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The enemy had you.&nbsp; You were in
league with the powers of darkness.&nbsp; Now, freedom and honor
sit upon your banners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they do,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
declare, whenever I thought of that poor little boy who honed to
come to school and wasn&rsquo;t allowed, it seemed to me I
couldn&rsquo;t stand it.&nbsp; I wanted to go out and do
something about it, but I didn&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked him up down the road a piece,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was playing with a little
snake&mdash;both of &rsquo;em having a nice pleasant
time&mdash;and I up and said: &lsquo;Why are you playing with
snakes instead of studying up at Ravenel School with the young
misses?&rsquo;&nbsp; And what do you think the little cuss
said?&nbsp; &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t as dangerous,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not as dangerous?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How is that?&rsquo;&nbsp; So he up and told me the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story whichever way you turn
here,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just listen, Mr. Thompson,
while I tell you the story of Paralee Panther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she told the tale of Paralee, of how her name was no name,
of her father, paralyzed, in <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>need of every comfort, and far from
all physicians&rsquo; aid and all neighborly service.&nbsp; Mr.
Thompson listened with deep interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troubles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is divided into two
kinds.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the kind you can&rsquo;t help and that
you&rsquo;d best forget; and there&rsquo;s the kind you can help
and that you want to get after.&nbsp; It looks to me as if this
is something to get after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all think so,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
we propose going to-morrow to see.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a nice boy
up here named Keefe O&rsquo;Connor, an artist&mdash;he helps us
in our school, too, almost every day&mdash;and he&rsquo;s going
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You-all don&rsquo;t have no call to go,&rdquo; said Mr.
Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not now, at any rate.&nbsp; Here I be, a
lazy old coot, with nothing else to do.&nbsp; Just let me go and
investigate these here Panthers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Azalea shook a finger at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thompson,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re the kind that can come up into
the mountains and just sit and look off at the view?&nbsp; You
know we aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We mean to go to that poor man.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s our adventure, don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; Rescuing
the helpless is the greatest fun there is.&nbsp; Why, the knights
of old found that out.&nbsp; After you&rsquo;ve tried all sorts
of <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>things, being rich and gay and all that, you come back
to that old idea.&nbsp; So we&rsquo;re setting out to rescue
somebody, and we simply can&rsquo;t be interfered with.&nbsp; But
you may come along if you like.&nbsp; It will make it twice as
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this &lsquo;nice boy,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Haystack, ever the watchful protector of Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
is he?&nbsp; Where does he come from?&nbsp; Who are his
folks?&nbsp; What kind of a job does he look to have&mdash;or is
he a shiftless good-for-nothing like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin, who felt the inquiries to be justified, flushed
slightly and Azalea distinctly frowned.&nbsp; It was Azalea who
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know a thing about him, and that&rsquo;s
a fact,&rdquo; she confessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We thought that
perhaps some day he&rsquo;d be telling us about himself, but he
never says a word.&nbsp; I think there&rsquo;s something he
doesn&rsquo;t want to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not,&rdquo; said Haystack, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not anything that he&rsquo;s ashamed of,&rdquo; put
in Azalea quickly, &ldquo;but something that it would make him
sad to tell.&nbsp; You know, Mr. Thompson, dear, that it&rsquo;s
just that way with me.&nbsp; There are things in my life I
don&rsquo;t want to speak of, ever, but nothing that I&rsquo;m
ashamed of.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>that way with me, why
shouldn&rsquo;t it be the same with others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, indeed, honey-bird?&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson
contritely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see this &lsquo;nice
boy,&rsquo; and pass judgment on him.&nbsp; Though, honor bright,
Zalie, I think your judgment ain&rsquo;t the worst in the
state.&nbsp; For a young-un you&rsquo;ve had a good deal of
experience in life and I reckon you have your own way of sizing
up folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result of all this, the next morning, early, in the best
of moods and with a spirit for kindly adventure burning within
them, a party of five started for Soco Mountain.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;sun ball,&rdquo; as the mountain folk call it, was
just showing a burning rim above the purple horizon when they set
out, with food in their saddle bags, matches in their pockets and
canteens of pure spring water on their backs.&nbsp; Food for the
horses and raincoats were buckled to the saddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short of breaking a nag&rsquo;s leg,&rdquo; said
Haystack Thompson, complacently, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first business of the day was to go for Paralee, who was
of course to be their guide.&nbsp; Living as she did a mile or
two back of Rowantree <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Hall, Azalea begged that they might
pass through the Rowantree estate, giving her a chance to speak a
word with Mary Cecily, whose haunting story stayed with her
almost constantly&mdash;all the more, perhaps, because she had
been forbidden to speak of it to anyone.&nbsp; The detour made
for the purpose was not great, and presently they were pounding
up the &ldquo;approach&rdquo; which Mr. Rowantree so
prized.&nbsp; But on this occasion the master of the house was
not sitting upon his gallery.&nbsp; Instead, they found him in
the &ldquo;drawing-room,&rdquo; clad in a snuff-covered silk
dressing gown, reading from an old red-bound copy of &ldquo;The
Lady of the Lake&rdquo; to the twins, Moira and Michael, while
little Mrs. Rowantree got the breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vocation I should have chosen,&rdquo; he said to
his guests after they were seated, &ldquo;is teaching the young
mind to expand.&nbsp; It is, I may say, one of the few things
which really interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rowantree, bustling about
to serve her guests with hot coffee, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell
you what a help it is to me, having Mr. Rowantree amuse the
children the way he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;instruct&rsquo; be a better word
than &lsquo;amuse,&rsquo; my dear?&rdquo; asked her husband.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, you do instruct as well as amuse
them,&rdquo; she cried loyally.&nbsp; &ldquo;You instruct us
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t amuse nor instruct me none,&rdquo; said
Haystack Thompson when they were on their way again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A great hulk of a man a-setting around while his little
wife lugs in the firewood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be horrible, the way she works and the way he
loafs,&rdquo; said Keefe, &ldquo;if it weren&rsquo;t that she is
happy.&nbsp; She likes to be doing things for him and the
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is a loafer,&rdquo; mused Haystack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know, because I&rsquo;m a loafer myself and I can
recognize one when I see him.&nbsp; But he puts on airs with his
loafing, and I swan, I don&rsquo;t like that.&nbsp; But say,
he&rsquo;s got cute children, ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; That there
little Constance said if I&rsquo;d stay she&rsquo;d call me
&lsquo;uncle.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed in a flattered way
at the remembrance of it.</p>
<p>They were soon at the little cabin where Paralee lived with
her grandmother and her brother.&nbsp; The brother they learned,
was already off at the sawmill, but the grandmother, bent double
with age, with two sharp teeth protruding from otherwise
toothless jaws, and with her face brown and furrowed, came out to
see her <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>granddaughter&rsquo;s guests.&nbsp; Her gimlet eyes
seemed to bore through them.&nbsp; She looked as if she knew many
things which she would not tell, and which, indeed, she ought not
to tell.&nbsp; Carin had brought her sketch book, and was eager
to make a drawing of old granny Panther, but she was given no
time, for Paralee was awaiting them, ready and impatient to lead
them on.&nbsp; She had no horse, but she said she wanted
none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can keep up with your horses,&rdquo; she told
Azalea.</p>
<p>Keefe wanted to lend her his mount, but at his offer she
frowned with vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be plagued,&rdquo; she said
sullenly, and set off down the road.&nbsp; Her strong, short body
moved over the ground with astonishing swiftness; and as she took
advantage of every cut-off, leaving the riders to go around by
the road, she soon proved that they would not be obliged to waste
time by waiting for her.&nbsp; The Gap was quickly crossed and
she turned up a shoulder of Dundee Mountain, where for an hour
the blowing horses had a hard climb.&nbsp; Then came a canter
along the almost level table-top of the mountain, till, having
reached the end of the plateau, the road began to descend.&nbsp;
The <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>great mountain reached out many arms, each of which
bore a name; and it was along one of these wooded reaches that
Paralee led them.&nbsp; By noon, a narrow valley was reached; and
here, beside a pleasant stream, the green solitude all about
them, they dismounted for their luncheon and to rest themselves
and their horses.</p>
<p>Paralee would not eat with them, though she accepted the
luncheon Azalea offered her.&nbsp; She walked away to a shady
spot, turned her back upon her companions and munched her food
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does she do it?&rdquo; Carin asked.&nbsp; It was
Haystack who knew the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does it because she&rsquo;s as proud as
Lucifer,&rdquo; he said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does it,&rdquo; echoed Azalea, &ldquo;because
she&rsquo;s afraid her manners won&rsquo;t be like
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does it because she is unhappy,&rdquo; said
Keefe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been unhappy, and I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time he had made a reference to his past
life.</p>
<p>But now there was another mountain to climb.&nbsp; It was low,
long, and dull-looking, and so heavily wooded that there was
little outlook.&nbsp; Azalea <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>said she believed that it was the
only mountain she ever had seen which she did not care for.&nbsp;
The road was so bad that it was impossible for a wagon to pass
over it; and even the horses had trouble making their way.&nbsp;
Only Paralee, grown up in that tangle, knew how to thread it with
ease.&nbsp; It was one of the few things which she did know well,
and as she went on, showing no sign of weariness, her awkwardness
and shyness began to drop from her.&nbsp; She was on her own
ground&mdash;the ground where she and her people had fought their
lonely fight for life; and she was carrying help to those whose
sorrows had been a savage grief to her.</p>
<p>Presently they reached a ragged clearing, stumbled past it to
an ill-kept garden, passed a number of pig pens and a large
chicken yard, and came upon the place that Paralee Panther called
home.&nbsp; It had been rather a pleasant cabin, once, perhaps,
in the old days when Thomas Panther had brought his bride there
and had &ldquo;aimed&rdquo; to be a farmer and woodsman.&nbsp;
But the roof now hardly gave shelter from the storms, the
shutters sagged from the unglassed windows, the steps had rotted
away, and one <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>mounted to the floor by means of ill-chosen stones
which had been placed before the door, and which rocked when they
were stepped upon.</p>
<p>Paralee plunged ahead to carry word to that desolated house
that visitors were at hand.</p>
<p>Visitors!</p>
<p>The word means little enough to most people, thought Azalea,
but to these strange, stricken people, these people who, as
Paralee said, had &ldquo;almost forgot how to talk,&rdquo; it
must be as the sight of a sail to one upon a desert island.&nbsp;
Perhaps they would fear as much as they would welcome it; yet
there was Paralee, dragging a gaunt woman to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em to &rsquo;light, ma, and come in,&rdquo;
begged the girl, using the mountaineers&rsquo; old phrase of
hospitality.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried Haystack Thompson,
just as if Mrs. Panther herself has spoken.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left Keefe to help the ladies from their mounts, and
himself went forward to shake this ghostlike woman by the
hand.&nbsp; She was tall and sunburned, thin past belief, and so
smitten by the silence and deadness of the days that she <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>looked like
a person who had lost some of her faculties.&nbsp; Yet now, with
a visible effort, she summoned back her knowledge of what should
be done when guests came.</p>
<p>The first glance in the cabin was enough.&nbsp; Its two beds,
its rickety chairs and uncovered table, were the whole of the
tale so far as furniture went, and a pathetic tale it was.&nbsp;
But the tragedy began with the man who lay in one of the
beds.&nbsp; His wandering, wild glance fell upon the visitors
with something like terror.&nbsp; His yellow skin clung to his
bones, and only one side of his body was alive.&nbsp; The other
was immovable in the curious half-death of paralysis.</p>
<p>It was Keefe who first went to him, for Mr. Thompson had
paused a moment, aghast at the sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must pardon us for coming to your home, sir,&rdquo;
he said in such a gentle and winning way that no one could have
resisted his plea.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is taking a liberty, we know,
but we heard how ill you were and how no doctor could get to
you.&nbsp; We are not doctors, but we mean to get you to one if
it will do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panther, it appeared, could talk but little.&nbsp; He shook
his head despairingly at Keefe&rsquo;s speech, <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>and made a
strange, inarticulate sound in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing won&rsquo;t help him,&rdquo; said his
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;A tree fell on him and he&rsquo;s got the
paraletics.&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t going to git well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She made the statement calmly.&nbsp; She was used to the idea; it
was her house-companion and always with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pete?&rdquo; asked Paralee.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he &rsquo;round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done lit out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Panther,
still in that dead voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lit out?&rdquo; cried Paralee.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s gone and run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Panther nodded again; and again the eyes of her husband
rolled wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he leave you all alone, ma?&rdquo; persisted
Paralee.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Th&rsquo;out anybody to do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My childer has all done that,&rdquo; said the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thar ain&rsquo;t nary one left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Paralee didn&rsquo;t mean to desert you,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried Azalea, unable to endure the spiritual
bleakness of that home another minute.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only
that she might find some way to help you that she left.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going to be a teacher; she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Mrs.
Panther lifted her sun-faded eyes and looked at Azalea with
unspeakable scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her!&nbsp; A teacher!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Azalea saw Paralee cower at this speech, and she knew then why
the girl was so sullen, so heavily sad.&nbsp; She had been
&ldquo;put down&rdquo; all her life, and she had grown to be like
a hateful, chained beast under it.</p>
<p>Then Miss Zillah spoke.&nbsp; She was occupying one of the
three chairs in the room, and in that bare and bitter place, she
looked&mdash;with her kind face and seemly garments&mdash;like a
being from another world than that in which poor Mrs. Panther
lived and had her aimless being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the wish to be a teacher, Mrs. Panther,&rdquo;
she said in her soft tones, &ldquo;and she has the brains for it
as well, so these young ladies tell me.&nbsp; In fact, I hear
that she understands book-studying better than most.&nbsp; We all
hope to help her, ma&rsquo;am, and to see you and your husband in
a different home from this.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have
neighbors and to be where a doctor could visit your
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Panther could not face Miss Pace as she
replied.&nbsp; There was too much she could not tell.&nbsp; How
could she leave the only spot <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>on earth that belonged to her?&nbsp;
How could they make any sort of a living elsewhere?&nbsp; Dare
she, who had no more clothes than the poorest beggar, go out into
the world?</p>
<p>Miss Zillah looked at her with her soft yet penetrating
gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all you&rsquo;re thinking, Mrs. Panther,&rdquo;
she said in tones that carried conviction to the heart,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll just ask you to trust in us and we&rsquo;ll
see you through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment or two no one spoke.&nbsp; Mr. Thompson was
leaving matters for the present in Miss Zillah&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; Keefe and the girls were silent with pity.&nbsp;
Never had they imagined anything so hopeless as the look on the
faces of that man and woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think of a dozen reasons why you
can&rsquo;t do this or that,&rdquo; went on Miss Zillah,
&ldquo;but I feel that every one of them can be
overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paralee had drawn nearer to her mother, and her dark eyes
shone like points of fire there in the gloom of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say yes, ma,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say
yes!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll all die here like snakes in our holes, if
you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Panther turned on her.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;What you talking to me for?&rdquo; she
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you turn your back on
me?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you make Jake leave?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
you take Granny?&nbsp; Much you care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Haystack Thompson arose.&nbsp; He towered till he almost
touched the roof of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Panther, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
ain&rsquo;t seeing things right, but I don&rsquo;t blame you
none.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a mountain man and I know how you
feel.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re proud.&nbsp; But this ain&rsquo;t a
question of pride.&nbsp; This is a question of saving
lives.&nbsp; Now, ma&rsquo;am, does it hurt your husband to move
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, awful,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;One side
don&rsquo;t feel, but to touch him hurts the other side
awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it, now?&rdquo; said the fiddler, his voice
quivering with sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder why?&nbsp; Ladies,
if you&rsquo;ll be so good as to step outside, I&rsquo;ll see if
I can find out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m something of a bone-setter in my
way.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Connor, will you lend a hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Mr. Thompson came to consult with the
ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;that the
man can be cured.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a broken collar
bone&mdash;broken in two places as I make out, and never
set&mdash;and it&rsquo;s pressing on nerves and muscles in <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>such a way
as to make him helpless.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way it looks to
me.&nbsp; Now, Miss Carin told me coming over, that she&rsquo;d
pay for his keep in a hospital at Asheville if only we could get
him there.&nbsp; It would be the death of him to take him in a
wagon; and he couldn&rsquo;t sit on a nag.&nbsp; So
O&rsquo;Connor and I have fixed it up that we&rsquo;ll carry him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Thompson,&rdquo;
objected Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so vigorous
as you used to be, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell me that, Miss Pace!&nbsp; Never tell me
that!&nbsp; Old Haystack&rsquo;s got muscle and he&rsquo;s got
grit.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve set me on doing
it more than ever, Miss Pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be all very well to carry him for a
mile,&rdquo; said the practical Azalea, &ldquo;but just think of
doing it for miles and miles&mdash;for twenty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to carry him that far.&nbsp; Say we
rig up a hammock and carry him ten miles.&nbsp; Then we&rsquo;ll
reach a wagon road.&nbsp; Meantime, you-all ride ahead, and have
a wagon waiting for us.&nbsp; Put a mattress on it with plenty of
pillows and comfortables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll bring along something to sustain <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>him,&rdquo;
added Aunt Zillah, forgetting all about her objections,
&ldquo;and some refreshments for you and Keefe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first thing you know we&rsquo;ll have him at
Bee Tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; put in Carin, &ldquo;we could get the
drawing room on a Pullman for him, and you and Keefe could go
with him to Asheville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure we
can do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is Mrs. Panther willing?&rdquo; asked Miss
Zillah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell whether she is or whether she
ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
fierce as a tiger.&nbsp; But then she&rsquo;s lived like a
tiger&mdash;only the hunting ain&rsquo;t been good.&nbsp; Say,
ladies, are you with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah fervently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be like taking a man from a living tomb.&nbsp; Of
course I can see there are many difficulties, but probably it is
best not to think too much about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idee exackly,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want to do anything, don&rsquo;t
waste your time thinking about the difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; went on Miss Zillah,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never reach the main road before
sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve thought of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson,
&ldquo;and what we propose is that we shall stay right here
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep in that house,&rdquo;
whispered Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Honestly, I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No call to,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson, flushing a
little, however, in spite of himself, out of loyalty to his
fellow mountain folk.&nbsp; &ldquo;You-all will sleep out in the
open.&nbsp; You can have the stars for your candles and the
sun-ball for your alarm clock.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Connor and I will
scrape up pine leaves for your beds.&nbsp; You can put your
raincoats around you, and maybe I can find an extra blanket to
help you out.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll build a fire and you can sleep
with your feet to it.&nbsp; Now, what&rsquo;s the matter with
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; cried Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Mr. Thompson, how sweet of you to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haystack Thompson grinned mockingly at his young friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, &lsquo;sweet&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked
derisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jest about as sweet as a green
persimmon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RESCUE, CONTINUED</span></h2>
<p>Breaking up a home is not an easy matter, even when the home
has little in it; nor is it a happy thing&mdash;no, not even when
the home has been a sad one.&nbsp; Moreover, it cannot be done in
an hour, even under the easiest conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come back some day, I reckon,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Panther to Miss Pace, looking about her at the bare room
with its broken fireplace and dingy walls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seems
like I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to live nowhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Panther gets well, maybe you&rsquo;ll be glad to
come back,&rdquo; faltered Aunt Zillah, trying to say the kind
thing, but thinking in her wise heart that these people were
perishing, soul and body, for lack of mixing with their
kind.&nbsp; But there was really too much to do to spend time
sighing over the breaking up.&nbsp; Even the one remaining hog
and the thirty odd chickens had to be planned for.&nbsp; It was
decided finally that Paralee was to drive the hog, and that such
of <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>the
chickens as were not eaten that night for supper, were to be put
in panniers fastened to the saddles and carried to the McEvoys
for safe keeping.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah wanted to help Mrs. Panther pack her clothes, but
she was not quite sure that there was anything to pack; and
indeed there was no more than could be put in a couple of old
melon-shaped baskets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes ain&rsquo;t come into my reckoning,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Panther quaintly, growing more sociable as she felt the
influence of Miss Zillah&rsquo;s genial atmosphere.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, anyway, there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nobody to see what
we had on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, Mr. Thompson and Keefe had, with the aid of Paralee,
been giving their attention to the hammock in which the sick man
was to be carried.&nbsp; The house contained one good blanket of
wool homespun, strong yet flexible.&nbsp; This, doubled, was
stretched upon poles, and since no stout rope could be found
about the place, heavy braided warp was fastened to these
poles.&nbsp; This improvised rope was to be slung over the
shoulders of the carriers.&nbsp; Azalea and Carin braided the
rope and found it a pleasant task.&nbsp; Indeed, they both were
very happy.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;It warms me all up,&rdquo; said Azalea,
&ldquo;to think of getting this poor man out of here and giving
him a chance, and I&rsquo;m just as glad for his wife as I am for
him.&nbsp; Talk of paralysis; Mrs. Panther has paralysis of the
soul, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Paralee changed?&rdquo; Carin cried, not
bothering to answer Azalea&rsquo;s question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s actually tidying up things.&nbsp; I saw her
straightening out the mess under the house with her one poor
hand.&nbsp; She wants the Panther house to fall to ruins
decently.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s going a good way&mdash;for
Paralee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you never can tell a thing about these mountain
people,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very likely, a few
generations back these silly Panthers, who ought to have called
themselves Marr, had no end of self-respect.&nbsp; Many, many
generations back, they may have been fine people.&nbsp; Marr
certainly is the name of one of the greatest of
families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it meant the same as Panther in the
beginning,&rdquo; surmised Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mars is the god of
war, and maybe the Marrs and the Panthers all got their names
because they were such good fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man had been carried out of doors <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>by Mr.
Thompson and Keefe, and placed where he could watch the
preparations that were being made for his journey.&nbsp; And
while he looked, not more than half-understanding, his great wild
eyes rolling in their sockets, his wife mixed hoe-cake, using the
last meal she possessed, and cooked it on the coals.&nbsp;
Chickens had been prepared with dispatch, and were boiling in the
pot, and Aunt Zillah, having given all necessary attention to
affairs within the house, was now gathering dewberries and
getting a fine bowl of them.</p>
<p>Presently the hammock was completed and supper was
served.&nbsp; Miss Zillah had persuaded Mrs. Panther to let them
eat it in the open, and they sat together, that strangely mingled
company, in the clear light of the long-lingering day, enjoying
their homely repast.&nbsp; The lovely evening, the wild spot, her
friends&mdash;so various, but so dear&mdash;the awakening light
in Paralee&rsquo;s eyes, the sense of being, somehow, on the
right road of the world, brought to Azalea&rsquo;s heart a sense
of dancing delight.&nbsp; She insisted on serving the chicken,
the hoecake and the hot decoction which Mrs. Panther was pleased
to call tea, making the others sit still while she waited on <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>them.&nbsp;
She could only be contented when she was doing something, it
seemed.</p>
<p>It was well on into the evening before the company was ready
for rest; for the last preparations for moving had to be made
that night if the company was to have an early morning
start.&nbsp; The horses had to be cared for, Mr. Panther made as
fit for civilization as possible, some sort of garments contrived
for Mrs. Panther, and the house and yard &ldquo;put
straight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everyone, save, of course, the helpless,
silent man upon his couch, turned in to help, Carin with the
rest.&nbsp; Once Azalea whispered to her friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that noise?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Paralee
laughing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Carin skeptically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It sounded to me rather like a frog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Paralee,&rdquo; declared Azalea seriously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It did sound a little like a frog, didn&rsquo;t it, but
just you wait a month or two, Carin Carson, and then hear how it
sounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin gave a tired little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take another step, Zalie,&rdquo; she
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;No matter what the rest of you do,
I&rsquo;ve got to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going to bed on this night meant rolling one&rsquo;s <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>self in a
raincoat, covering one&rsquo;s self with some coarse handmade
sheeting, and lying straight upon a bed of pine needles with
one&rsquo;s face to the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem nearly so tired and sleepy as I
am, Zalie dear.&nbsp; Sit by me and hold my hand,&rdquo; pleaded
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lie next me, won&rsquo;t
you&mdash;quite close?&nbsp; The mountain seems huge,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Like a kind beast.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it
breathing?&nbsp; I feel as if it were breathing.&nbsp; Deep
breaths.&nbsp; Where do you suppose my own, own father and mother
are to-night?&nbsp; It was queer that I didn&rsquo;t want to go
with them, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I wonder if it was because I
didn&rsquo;t wish to leave you, &lsquo;honey-bird&rsquo;&mdash;as
Mr. Thompson calls you.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t he bring his
fiddle?&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t look right to me without his
fiddle.&nbsp; Oh&mdash;h, how tired I am.&nbsp; Sing, Azalea:
&lsquo;Now the day is over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin hummed the first line; Azalea took it up at the second,
and the soft silence of the night was broken by the harmony of
their voices.&nbsp; Azalea remembered the evening, long ago, when
she had heard Carin and her father and mother singing that far
down the trail.&nbsp; That was the night they had come to ask her
to be Carin&rsquo;s <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>adopted sister&mdash;the night she
had weighed her love for Ma McBirney in the balance with riches
and opportunity, and had decided in favor of the mountain cabin
and Ma McBirney&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Carin slept quickly, but she was over-tired; her slender
shoulders twitched spasmodically, and the hand Azalea held would
clutch and then as suddenly relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, me,&rdquo; thought Azalea, suddenly anxious,
&ldquo;are we forgetting how delicate and tender she is?&nbsp;
What if she should be ill, with her mother so far away!&nbsp; We
aren&rsquo;t looking after her the way we ought.&nbsp; She
can&rsquo;t stand the things the rest of us can.&nbsp; I must
have a talk with Aunt Zillah at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her hand softly from Carin&rsquo;s grasp and looked
about her for Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; Someone paced slowly up and down
beneath the trees at no great distance, and Azalea ran to see who
it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Keefe,&rdquo; said a voice in answer to
her low inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not the person you&rsquo;re looking
for, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to be looking for Aunt Zillah,&rdquo; said
Azalea; &ldquo;but why shouldn&rsquo;t I be looking for you,
Keefe O&rsquo;Connor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;Because you never do&mdash;you never
have&mdash;never will.&nbsp; Nobody looks for me.&nbsp; Nobody
worries about me.&nbsp; I come and go as I please&mdash;and
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I had some hope at the beginning of
the season that Mrs. Rowantree would worry about me&mdash;she
seemed so nice.&nbsp; But she hasn&rsquo;t a speck of worry to
spare from Himself and the children.&nbsp; Then I thought maybe
Miss Pace would devote at least ten minutes a day to worrying
about me, but <i>she</i> hasn&rsquo;t shown a sign of it.&nbsp;
She never asks me where I come from or who I am, or why I am,
or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Keefe O&rsquo;Connor, you&rsquo;re as unjust as
you can be.&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t asked you&mdash;none of us has
asked you&mdash;because we thought that for some reason you
didn&rsquo;t want to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe stopped short in his pacing, and standing twenty feet
from the girl, let one cold word drop between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrid way of saying &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;&rdquo;
cried Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I meant just what I said and not
anything more.&nbsp; You know very well that we&rsquo;ve liked
you from the first, Keefe, and that it never would occur to us to
think anything about you that&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t nice.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter with <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>you to-night, anyway?&nbsp; I feel
as if, whatever I said, you&rsquo;d put some meaning into it that
I didn&rsquo;t want put there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m homesick&mdash;for a home I never
had.&nbsp; I want to see the kin I haven&rsquo;t got.&nbsp; I
want to know my own name.&nbsp; I want to
understand&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off and let the words rest
quivering upon the air.&nbsp; Azalea drew a little nearer in the
gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know any of those things,
Keefe?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice sounded awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Azalea, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I have, I believe, the
strangest story in the world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve wanted and wanted
to tell it to you, but I&rsquo;ve been afraid that
you&mdash;well, that you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, or perhaps
that you wouldn&rsquo;t like me so well after you knew
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Keefe, tell me now!&nbsp; I should love to hear a
strange story to-night.&nbsp; I love to live under the sky,
don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; When I was a little girl I often slept out
like this with my poor mamma.&nbsp; Oh, Keefe, how I wish you had
known my poor little mother!&nbsp; Where shall we sit while you
tell me the story?&nbsp; Or would you rather we walked back and
forth?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>But
before Keefe could reply, Miss Zillah, with Paralee and her
mother, came from the house and joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paralee wishes to sleep out here with us,
Azalea,&rdquo; said Miss Pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will be very
nice, won&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Mrs. Panther has come to say good
night, my dear.&nbsp; I tell her she must get to bed.&nbsp;
To-morrow will be a trying day, though, I hope, a happy one,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe and Azalea stood silent for a moment.&nbsp; Their little
moment of enchantment was shattered and it was hard for them to
hide their disappointment.&nbsp; Then Azalea tried to say what
was expected of her, but Mrs. Panther broke in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it on my mind,&rdquo; she said slowly,
&ldquo;to say how I feel about you-all coming away out here to
help me and my man.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard for me to say, for I
ain&rsquo;t used to strangers.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more,
it&rsquo;s a good while since I had call to thank anyone.&nbsp;
Things has been against me and folks has been against me.&nbsp;
My own children has been against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they hain&rsquo;t, ma.&nbsp; No, they
hain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Paralee excitedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see it hain&rsquo;t so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t get clear in my mind,&rdquo; went on
the woman, paying no heed to Paralee&rsquo;s wistful <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>tug at her
sleeve, &ldquo;is why you-all should trouble yourselves to come
up here on something that ain&rsquo;t no concern of
yourn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have done just the same, wouldn&rsquo;t you,
Mrs. Panther,&rdquo; said Azalea in her light, almost gay little
way, &ldquo;if you had heard we were in trouble and had known you
could help us out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, me?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Panther.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never helped nobody.&nbsp; Never had the chanct.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again the bitterness came into her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you the chance sometime, Mrs.
Panther,&rdquo; said Azalea, laughing softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
you&rsquo;ll help me the very best you know how; won&rsquo;t she,
Aunt Zillah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that they parted.&nbsp; Keefe and Mr. Thompson slept at
some distance, guarding the path&mdash;though indeed there was no
one to guard it against.&nbsp; Aunt Zillah and her girls lay
beneath a hemlock tree.&nbsp; Beside them, Paralee watched the
slow roll of the stars till far into the night, unable to sleep
for the thoughts that beset her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay in the house,&rdquo; she
whispered to Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;It made me think of the dark
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dark days?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;Before I went away&mdash;when I thought we was
forgot by all on the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was good to them; the wind was low and kind; the dew
softer than fairy fingers; the stars softly bright.&nbsp; Even
the dawn did not come blazing upon them.&nbsp; In pink and gray,
delicately it smiled from the farther hills.&nbsp; True, all
night long the whippoorwill teased the air with his foolish song,
but all there were too used to the notes of his voice to
heed.</p>
<p>An hour after sunup, the procession was on its way.&nbsp; Mrs.
Panther and Paralee rode the horses which had carried Keefe and
Haystack Thompson the day before.&nbsp; In the panniers by their
side cackled the excited and displeased chickens, and following
them came the equally surprised and disgusted pig, for whom Keefe
had constructed a harness by means of which Paralee led
him.&nbsp; Last of all came Keefe and Haystack, carrying the
paralyzed man in his hammock.</p>
<p>The little house looked wretchedly deserted when Paralee had
closed its shutters and Keefe nailed up its door.&nbsp; He
noticed that Mrs. Panther kept her head turned away from it and
he wondered if she had, after all, some strange, <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>irrational
love for this grim place, where she had suffered so much, and
known such bitter solitude.</p>
<p>Well, he reflected, the wrench would soon be over.&nbsp; Ten
minutes took them out of sight of the house.&nbsp; They presently
were out of the clearing and picking their way along the most
terrible road in a country of bad roads.&nbsp; The drag of the
sick man&rsquo;s weight, half-skeleton though he was, was more of
a burden than Keefe thought it would be.&nbsp; At the end of the
first mile it seemed to him that he could not go on; but oddly
enough, the second mile found him getting accustomed to the
task.&nbsp; With Haystack Thompson, however, the carrying of this
dead weight seemed to be but a small hardship.&nbsp; Though
making the best baskets in the country and playing the violin
with the touch of wild genius were not occupations to strengthen
muscles, still Thompson was capable of great exertion.&nbsp;
Keefe, who walked behind him, looked at his great shoulders with
envy.</p>
<p>Miss Pace, with Azalea and Carin, had ridden on ahead as fast
as they could push their horses, in order to send the McEvoy
wagon to the point where the rough trail met the wagon
road.&nbsp; They <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>had no fear of losing their way, for the marks their
horses had made the previous day were their sure guide.&nbsp; So
if they were anxious, it was not for themselves.&nbsp; Their fear
was for the two burden-bearers.&nbsp; Azalea had seen from the
first that Keefe was finding the task a very difficult one.&nbsp;
He was not strong in the way her good Haystack was, and he never
would be.&nbsp; She thought of his delicate, long,
&ldquo;clever&rdquo; hands, that could handle the sketching
pencil or the painter&rsquo;s brush so deftly, of all his quick,
kind, charming ways, and wondered again what the story could be
that he wanted to tell her, and how it was that he seemed so
alone in the world.</p>
<p>The day was proving itself a surprisingly hot one for that
altitude.&nbsp; Azalea was glad to remember the canteens of cold
water that the men carried with them, and hoped Haystack would
tell Keefe to put green leaves in his hat to keep his head
cool.&nbsp; She wondered if there was danger of sunstroke away up
on the mountains and wanted to ask Miss Pace, but for some reason
didn&rsquo;t quite like to.&nbsp; Too much anxiety about Keefe
might bring out Carin&rsquo;s little teasing smile.&nbsp; Anyway,
it was no time for asking questions.&nbsp; She urged Paprika
ahead of the <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>others, and rode him over the stubble, through the
bushes, across the fords, until at last she reached the
well-traveled road.&nbsp; Here she watered him lightly, and
breathed him for a few minutes.&nbsp; Then she flicked the reins
on his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home, pony,&rdquo; she called sharply.&nbsp; Paprika
gave a little sniff as much as to say that he had supposed that
was what he <i>was</i> doing, and reaching out with his tough
little legs, he fairly flew over the ground.&nbsp; Carin set her
pretty Mustard at the same pace.&nbsp; The ponies had been bred
together and were equally matched, yet to-day Mustard did not
seem quite the equal of Paprika, and Mustard&rsquo;s mistress
wondered why.&nbsp; But Aunt Zillah knew.&nbsp; The difference
lay, not in the ponies, but in the riders.&nbsp; It was Azalea
whose aching sympathy with those she had left behind her,
diffused itself through the heart and lungs and legs of her
staunch little mount, giving him a speed he seldom had known
before.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was an all but fainting pony that was drawn up at
last by the McEvoy steps.&nbsp; Azalea had slipped from her
saddle as the little creature swayed, and guessing at his
trouble, had snatched up a pail of water which stood upon the
house steps and dashed it over his face.&nbsp; <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Miles
McEvoy, placidly smoking his pipe in the shade of a sweet gum
tree, came to her aid, but she waved him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitch the horses to the wagon,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and please ask Mrs. McEvoy to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McEvoy, the leisurely, stared for one second.&nbsp; Then,
putting a question or two, and receiving Azalea&rsquo;s clear
answers, he strode away to do her bidding.&nbsp; Azalea got the
saddle off her weary little mount and ran to get the necessaries
for the relief wagon, explaining as she worked.&nbsp; A few
moments later, Miss Zillah and Carin arrived, Carin too jaded to
be of much service just then, but Aunt Zillah full of
expedients.</p>
<p>So in less than an hour, McEvoy, with his wife beside him, was
on his way, and the three who were left behind were making free
in the bedroom of the many bottles, getting all in readiness for
Mr. Panther.</p>
<p>At midnight they laid the sick man on Mrs. McEvoy&rsquo;s best
feather bed.&nbsp; Very deep and soft and sweet it was, and very
kindly and safe looked the homely room.&nbsp; Miss Zillah&rsquo;s
soup was hot and savory, and her tea had comfort in it for the
weary.&nbsp; Azalea and Carin, swift-footed and eager, rendered
all the service in their <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>power, and at length, when every
task was performed, with their lanterns in their hands, they,
with Miss Zillah, started for their home.</p>
<p>Keefe O&rsquo;Connor was sitting without the door waiting for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see you safe, please,&rdquo; he said in
rather a curious voice.&nbsp; Azalea looked at him to see what
was the matter, but the lantern revealed nothing more than a
white and strained face.&nbsp; She noticed that he was unusually
silent as they made their way over the path of pine needles to
the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest, but for the matter of that, none of them
felt talkative.&nbsp; She certainly was not prepared to see him,
when he had unlocked the cabin door for them, reel suddenly and
fall unconscious across the threshold.</p>
<h2><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">KEEFE</span></h2>
<p>Miss Zillah laid a hand on Azalea&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so frightened,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s overstrained his heart, no doubt.&nbsp; Find a
match.&nbsp; Light the lamps.&nbsp; Carin, help me lift
him&mdash;well, drag him then.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get him to the
lounge.&nbsp; No hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea, fumbling for the matches and missing them, wondered
why Miss Zillah had spoken to her.&nbsp; How had she known that
her heart stopped beating at the sight of Keefe prone across the
doorstep?&nbsp; And if she was more frightened than the others,
how had she shown it&mdash;and why, indeed, <i>should</i> she
care more than they?</p>
<p>Then she knew.&nbsp; She was only a young girl, but she
knew.&nbsp; Somehow, mysteriously and beautifully in this lonely
old world, we are able to pick out our own.&nbsp; We know, as we
eye them, those who will make us feel befriended and comfortable
and safe.&nbsp; At least, we think we <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>know, and even when we find we have
been mistaken, we have had the sweetness of the hour of apparent
discovery.&nbsp; Yes, it was true; Azalea admitted it as with
trembling hands she lighted the lamps, shuddering at the sound of
that body being dragged across the floor.&nbsp; Keefe
O&rsquo;Connor, who had said that he did not know his own right
name, who admitted that his life had been strange and sad and
unsettled, had seemed to her, from the first, like some one she
always had known&mdash;some one it would be a wicked folly to
lose out of her life.</p>
<p>Pa McBirney had warned her that she was too impulsive.&nbsp;
He had told her that she must watch out for this very thing, and
she had promised him that she would try to put a guard upon
herself.&nbsp; Yet by a swift understanding which she could not
explain, she had felt from the first that she could trust this
lad; could forgive him when he needed forgiveness, and take life
as it came, with poverty or plenty, with good or ill luck, if he
were near to praise her for the long day&rsquo;s work, or to
laugh with her when play-time came.&nbsp; And now perhaps he was
dying!</p>
<p>There, the lamps were lighted at last!&nbsp; She <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>had touched
a match to the kindling in the fireplace; she had tossed on a
log.&nbsp; She was willing to do anything rather than turn her
face and look upon that white one on the couch where Aunt Zillah
and Carin, breathing hard, had managed to lift the inert body of
her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make some black coffee, quick, Azalea,&rdquo; she heard
Aunt Zillah saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make it very strong.&nbsp;
Carin, come hold the light while I look in my medicine
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black coffee, very strong!&nbsp; How did one make that?&nbsp;
Azalea could not think.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quick, quick,&rdquo; Aunt
Zillah had said.&nbsp; Azalea gave up thinking, because her hands
were doing the work.&nbsp; She found that she could trust them,
that some faithful servant in her confused house of thought was
doing the work for her.&nbsp; The coffee was ground, the fire was
lighted, the pot set on&mdash;all as it should be&mdash;and still
it was not of coffee that she was thinking, but of that white
face which she would not look at; that fluttering breath that
seemed to cease.</p>
<p>She could hear Miss Zillah slapping the cold hands of the boy
there on the couch; could hear her speaking to him and getting no
answer.&nbsp; She wondered why Carin didn&rsquo;t come to her to
say <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>something&mdash;to tell her how he was faring.&nbsp;
Did they expect her to think of nothing but coffee, coffee,
coffee&mdash;particularly when it seemed never to boil, never to
get where it would be of any use?</p>
<p>When she carried the coffee into the living room, he was
breathing heavily.&nbsp; His eyes were partly opened, and Miss
Zillah had loosened his shirt at the neck, and had poured water
over his face and hair.&nbsp; It made him look so
strange&mdash;so different from the way he usually looked.&nbsp;
And yet, though he looked so different, he seemed familiar, too,
in a new way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not of himself that he reminds me,&rdquo;
thought Azalea, &ldquo;but of some one else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
resemblance was pleasant to her, as if the person he made her
think of was some one she liked, though she could not think who
it was.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah lifted him up and held him steady while Azalea fed
him from the spoon with the strong black coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your hand tremble,&rdquo; said Miss
Zillah rather sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about your
fears, Azalea.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got to have the coffee.&nbsp; His
heart needs stimulating.&nbsp; Give it to him and stop
trembling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Azalea wouldn&rsquo;t have supposed it possible that by
the mere exercise of will she could stop the shaking of her hand,
but when Miss Zillah spoke to her that way, she steadied
herself.</p>
<p>Did the moments go fast or slow?&nbsp; She could not
tell.&nbsp; She gave him the full cup of coffee and went for
more.&nbsp; Carin had heated some hot water and had put it in
rubber bags at his hands and feet.&nbsp; He had been wrapped
warm, and now, little by little, the horrid purple of his lips
began to turn into something more like their usual color.&nbsp;
His lids opened with a flutter and he saw those about him.&nbsp;
He smiled piteously, like a little boy, and closed his eyes
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect rest is what he needs now,&rdquo; said Miss
Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;He may have to be quiet for days.&nbsp; It
takes much longer to rest a heart than it does to tire it.&nbsp;
Go to bed now, girls.&nbsp; What a day you&rsquo;ve had!&nbsp;
Mercy, what would your people think, Carin, if they knew all you
have been through?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think of getting up in the
morning, or of going to school.&nbsp; The very thought of your
falling ill distresses me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed outrageous to leave the gentle Miss Zillah there,
her face all drawn with anxiety, <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>alone with that almost unconscious
boy, but she insisted upon having her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you,&rdquo; she assured the girls,
&ldquo;if there&rsquo;s anything you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any least thing&mdash;&rdquo; begged Azalea.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah nodded.&nbsp; So the two crept away to their bed
behind the great chimney and the screens, but they did not
undress; only lay down in their wrappers and with the light
burning beside them.&nbsp; Carin dropped into a heavy sleep and
lay there so sunken in the bed that Azalea had her to worry about
too.&nbsp; Being of knightly spirit and rescuing folk in distress
was rather an expensive business, it appeared.&nbsp; If anything
happened to Carin or to Keefe, would the rescue of the Panthers
have been worth it?&nbsp; It was not a pleasant question to dwell
upon, and Azalea tried not to think of the answer.</p>
<p>She was not sure whether she slept or not.&nbsp; The wall
between sleeping and waking was transparent, like glass, and she
could see through it.&nbsp; So it was a relief when morning came
and she could get out of bed.&nbsp; She was stiff and half sick,
but when she had taken her cold bath in the little dressing room
they had contrived in <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>the shed, and had got into her clean
clothes, she began to feel better.&nbsp; Carin tried in vain to
shake her sleepiness off, but she was so wan and worn-looking
that Azalea sternly commanded her to keep her bed.&nbsp; In the
front room Miss Zillah slept wearily in the arm chair, and Keefe,
his eyes wide open, lay watching her.&nbsp; He held up his finger
for silence as Azalea drew near, and she slipped out again,
comforted at his appearance, to get the breakfast.</p>
<p>In the midst of it, she saw some one coming down the
path.&nbsp; It was Paralee, swinging along with her great
stride.&nbsp; She still wore her hideous, outgrown, ragged dress,
but for all that she looked changed from what she had been.&nbsp;
Her hair was smoothly combed, her face properly washed, and there
was hope in her eye and decision in her step.</p>
<p>Azalea slipped out of the door to speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How be you all?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Azalea told her, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that a pity, now?&rdquo; sighed
Paralee.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew that boy wasn&rsquo;t peart enough
for such a long tug.&nbsp; I wanted him to let me carry pa part
of the way, but he wouldn&rsquo;t hear to it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
jest beat out; that&rsquo;s what ails him.&nbsp; Lying quiet <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>is the best
thing he can do, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Azalea anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, oh, Paralee, how ever am I to get over to school
to-day?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so stiff I can hardly move; and
there&rsquo;s so much to be done here at the house that I
don&rsquo;t believe I ought to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a pity,&rdquo; said Paralee, kicking
viciously at a stone, &ldquo;that I ain&rsquo;t got my eddication
yet!&nbsp; I would jest love to do that thar teaching for
you-all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you could,&rdquo; sighed Azalea
fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you seem to be the only person around
here who even wants to do such a thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off her sentence suddenly, remembering that she had
heard Mr. Rowantree say that teaching was the one thing in the
way of work that he actually enjoyed.&nbsp; She told Paralee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d do it,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if only I
had some way of getting word to him.&nbsp; It seems such a pity
to break up school just when we&rsquo;re getting it so nicely
started, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And this is little Skully
Simms&rsquo; first day, too!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t really answer
for what might happen if he got there and met the Coulters and
their friends face to face.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;Oh, that thar Bud Coulter&rsquo;ll keep his word
about not tetching the little cuss,&rdquo; said Paralee
placidly.&nbsp; (She was a Coulter in her sympathies.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Miss Azalea, you jest say
the word and I&rsquo;ll run shortcuts over to the Rowantrees and
tell them what&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, will you, Paralee?&nbsp; Dare you?&nbsp;
Oughtn&rsquo;t you to be with your father and mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all right, I reckon.&nbsp;
Mr. Thompson, he&rsquo;s to take &rsquo;em down to the afternoon
train.&nbsp; Pa ain&rsquo;t looking very peart, but it
warn&rsquo;t to be expected that he would.&nbsp; Ma acts like she
was scared to death, but Mis&rsquo; McEvoy&rsquo;s fixing her out
in proper clothes.&nbsp; Mr. McEvoy, he&rsquo;s gone down to Bee
Tree to do some telegraphing about the hospital pa&rsquo;s to go
in.&nbsp; My, ain&rsquo;t they rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich!&rdquo; cried Azalea aghast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the McEvoys and Mr. Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich!&rdquo; repeated Azalea.&nbsp; But the words died
on her lips.&nbsp; So Paralee thought the McEvoys in their
two-roomed cabin, and good old Haystack with his fiddle,
rich!&nbsp; She only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had breakfast, Paralee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;Come in then.&nbsp; Things are cooked now, and
you can eat and then run to Rowantree&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But you
<i>are</i> obliging, Paralee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paralee looked at her with something akin to impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; she said deep in her throat,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you thank me for nothing, you hear?&nbsp; If I
was to crawl on my hands and knees around this here mountain, it
wouldn&rsquo;t even up with what you&rsquo;re doing for me.&nbsp;
Why, Miss Azalea, I thought I&rsquo;d go crazy thinking about my
pa and ma in that thar place&mdash;plumb crazy, that&rsquo;s what
I thought I&rsquo;d go.&nbsp; Ma laid it up against Pete for
running away.&nbsp; I tell you, he had to.&nbsp; It got so awful
he just had to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he did,&rdquo; said Azalea
sympathetically.&nbsp; She knew very well&mdash;for she was still
a child&mdash;that there are troubles so dark and hopeless that
children cannot endure them.</p>
<p>A few moments later, standing by the door, she saw Paralee
striding along the old, overgrown road that ran toward Rowantree
Hall.</p>
<p>She had confidence, somehow, that Mr. Rowantree would not fail
her.&nbsp; Indolent he might be, odd and proud and vexatious he
undeniably was, yet he had a reverence for the seeking <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>mind, and
she felt he would not let these mountain children ask in
vain.</p>
<p>She was quite right.&nbsp; An hour before school time she saw
him mounted on a sorry nag, which he rode magnificently and as if
it were the most dashing of horse flesh, coming toward her
door.&nbsp; He dismounted with a splendid gesture, and riding
crop in hand, came forward toward the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest.&nbsp;
By this time Aunt Zillah was sleeping properly in her bed, and
Keefe, wide-eyed and restless, lay on the sofa with instructions
neither to move nor talk.&nbsp; So Azalea met Mr. Rowantree
outside the door and hurriedly told him all the story of the past
two days.&nbsp; As he stood there on the little porch, he, being
tall, could look well over her head at the figure of Keefe lying
stretched upon the sofa.&nbsp; It was a sight to make him sorry,
but not one, it would seem, to hold him fascinated.&nbsp; Yet he
gazed and gazed; then, trying to look away, looked in again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it that boy looks like, Miss Azalea?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somebody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied Azalea under her breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Somebody&mdash;but who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could not decide, and let it pass.&nbsp; Azalea <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>went over
to the schoolhouse with Mr. Rowantree and introduced the pupils
to him, and gave him an idea of what was to be studied for the
day.&nbsp; Mr. Rowantree looked somewhat out of place in the
little schoolhouse, to tell the truth; he was so tall, so fine,
so altogether magnificent with his reddish brown hair and
whiskers and his snowy suit of frayed linen.&nbsp; The children
seemed rather awed by him, but Azalea noticed that little Skully
Simms kept close to him, preferring him, with all his
strangeness, to the Coulters, although the warlike Bud had given
bond for good behavior.</p>
<p>When she got back home, the house was very still.&nbsp; Carin
was lying in the hammock asleep.&nbsp; There were circles under
her eyes, and the lovely wild rose bloom was gone from her
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take better care of her,&rdquo; thought Azalea
for the twentieth time, stealing past her into the house.&nbsp;
Aunt Zillah was giving Keefe some milk, and treating him as
gently as if he were glass and might break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she said as she left the room,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s not to talk.&nbsp; Two or three days of perfect
rest will, in my opinion, make him all right.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t anything unusual for a young man to overstrain <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>his
heart.&nbsp; He might have done it in school athletics and then
he wouldn&rsquo;t have been a hero at all.&nbsp; Mr. Thompson was
looking for you, Zalie.&nbsp; He starts in a short time for Bee
Tree, so that Mr. Panther may have a little rest between his
wagon ride and his train journey.&nbsp; Mr. Thompson is going
with him straight to the hospital.&nbsp; Carin gave him the
money&mdash;except for a little&mdash;a very
little&mdash;addition which I made.&nbsp; So now, all is well
again, or on the way to be well, and you must go and lie
down.&nbsp; Take a glass of milk first and sleep as long as you
can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going out to see to the chickens.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve been sadly neglected, poor things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea stood in the cool, tidy little room vaguely regarding
the lad on the sofa.&nbsp; He looked amazingly long as he lay
stretched out, all relaxed and pallid like that.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;sad-glad&rdquo; look which Azalea so often had noticed on
his face, was there now.&nbsp; He held out his hand for her to
come nearer and when she was close enough he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to be staying here, Miss Azalea.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s making trouble I am for Miss Pace and the rest of
you.&nbsp; Anyway, it&rsquo;s not fitting for me to <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>be
here.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t this a sort of nunnery?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
smiled in his sidelong, whimsical fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my
tent was to be fixed up right I could wait on myself well enough,
and Mr. McEvoy could be bringing me over a drop of soup now and
then or a pail of milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea made no protest, for she knew how he felt.&nbsp; She
would have felt the same way in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We love to have you here,&rdquo; she said softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We truly love it.&nbsp; And it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe yet
for you to go to your tent.&nbsp; But I was
thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would it be if you went to Rowantree Hall, and got
some one&mdash;Bud Coulter, or some one like that&mdash;to wait
on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Azalea&rsquo;s surprise he looked up with eagerness in the
eyes that a moment before had been so lackluster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wonder if it <i>could</i> be arranged,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like that.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell
why, but I should like it more than anything.&nbsp; Miss Azalea,
will you see if it can be done?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m terribly
tired.&nbsp; I&mdash;I should like beyond words to go
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>A
sharp little grip of jealousy that he should prefer Rowantree
Hall to the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest had Azalea by the throat and kept
her from answering.&nbsp; But she was ashamed of that pang even
while she suffered from it, and nodding reassuringly, she went
into the kitchen to attend to the neglected duties there.</p>

207</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BLAB BOY</span></h2>
<p>Meantime, Mr. Rowantree (who loved teaching) was having his
experiences.&nbsp; He had been in the habit of instructing his
own children, who, from early infancy had been taught to listen
and to learn.&nbsp; Indeed, there was nothing they would rather
do.&nbsp; They knew almost all of the great stories for children
that have been written by the different peoples of the world, and
they were so used to having their father speak partly in English,
partly in Latin and partly in French, that they did not mind that
at all.&nbsp; Very likely he may have ventured to throw in a
little German or Italian now and then&mdash;he certainly could
have done so if he wished.&nbsp; Then, too, he had taught them
their notes in the music book; and he had made figures seem like
a game to them.&nbsp; Really, he had done little else since they
were born but train them and teach them, and their minds answered
to his as the strings of a harp respond to a piano.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>Imagine then, his feelings, when he was left alone to
deal with the twenty-one pupils&mdash;including Mrs.
McIntosh&mdash;of the Ravenel school.&nbsp; He tried his best to
realize how little they knew, but he really could not do
it.&nbsp; He had begun with Skully Simms because Azalea had
particularly begged him to look after the boy, owing to the
peculiar circumstances under which he had come to school, and he
set him a little reading lesson to con.&nbsp; Then he turned to
Mrs. McIntosh, whose eagerness to learn, grown woman as she was,
seemed to him very touching.&nbsp; But he was interrupted by
Skully, who in a high-pitched voice and a wild singsong something
like that used by the traveling preachers at a camp meeting, was
going on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-h-e, the, c-a-t, cat, s-a-w, saw, a r-a-t,
rat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that noise, sir?&rdquo; thundered
Mr. Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you study to
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skully looked terribly embarrassed and buried his scarlet face
down behind his book.&nbsp; Mr. Rowantree regarded him something
as a king looks at a cat&mdash;a stray, wayside cat&mdash;and
resumed his instruction, only to hear a moment <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>later the
wild, high notes of Skully breaking out again.</p>
<p>He turned on the little boy in his most majestic manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have the goodness to tell me&mdash;&rdquo; he
began.&nbsp; But he was interrupted by a chorus of explanatory
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been to a blab school, sir,&rdquo; the other
children declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t know how to study
no other way.&nbsp; Once you&rsquo;ve got the blab way o&rsquo;
l&rsquo;arning, you can&rsquo;t do no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowantree grasped the meaning of the statement.&nbsp; He
had heard of the &ldquo;blab schools&rdquo; where each pupil
studied his lesson aloud, often at the top of his lungs.&nbsp; He
looked about him expecting to see the Coulter crowd doubled up
with scornful mirth.&nbsp; But he saw nothing of the sort.&nbsp;
The children there understood the difficulties of Skully.&nbsp;
Nay, they firmly believed that when once the blab habit was
settled on a person it could not be got rid of.&nbsp; They
expected to see the schoolmaster fall into a terrible rage and
they naturally looked forward to it with a not altogether
innocent glee.&nbsp; But Mr. Rowantree, it seemed, could be a
surprising person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said to Skully <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>politely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp;
It will be rather bothersome for you to break off the habit of
studying aloud, but of course you must, for it puts other people
out very much, don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; This morning I will
allow you to move your lips as you study, but you must not speak
aloud.&nbsp; By to-morrow I shall hope that you can study without
even moving your lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; said poor Skully, and he tried as hard
as ever he could with his untutored, eager little mind, to do as
he should in the school which he so very much wished to
attend.&nbsp; But it was hard work, and from time to time his
high-pitched singsong voice would break from the whisper to which
it was held in leash and would cause Mr. Rowantree to hold up a
warning finger.&nbsp; Then, Skully, scarlet-faced and wretched,
would try again.</p>
<p>This, however, was not the only excitement of the day.&nbsp;
Just before noon the instructor was surprised to see a very long,
very thin, very dust-colored man appear in the doorway.&nbsp; It
was not only his homespun clothes which appeared
dust-colored.&nbsp; His hair and skin, even his eyes, had a faded
yellowish hue.</p>
<p>He leaned forward, peering in the room <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>curiously,
his high, arched nose seeming to smell out what his eyes did not
at first discover.&nbsp; Then he shot out his long arm and
pointed at little Mrs. McIntosh, where she sat, her worn yet
girlish face white with nervousness, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you-all to git out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment no one spoke.&nbsp; The woman had not
arisen.&nbsp; A little look of trembling bravery shone in her
eyes.&nbsp; She seemed to be seeking for some words in which to
express her thoughts and not finding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear?&rdquo; cried the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You-all
git out of that thar seat and come to home whar you belong.&nbsp;
Thissen ain&rsquo;t no place for a married woman.&nbsp; You
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowantree had been stroking his long ruddy mustache with
his white hand, waiting, it seemed, for developments.&nbsp; But
now he came forward, bearing upon his handsome face a look not
unlike that he had turned upon Skully a while before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. McIntosh is your wife, I suppose,&rdquo; he said
in his easy, pleasant way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You jest bet she is,&rdquo; said the man defiantly,
&ldquo;and I want her to home.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s making me the
laughing stock of the hull place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree, quite
politely.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they laughing at?&nbsp; Excuse me
if I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re laughing because a married woman leaves
her home and sets in school with childer, l&rsquo;arning like she
was five years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They probably are not aware that men and women of the
most learned sort go to universities until they are much older
than Mrs. McIntosh.&nbsp; Naturally, they wouldn&rsquo;t know
that, would they?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that
folk here on the mountain would be liable to hear
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know &rsquo;nough,&rdquo; said the man
sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We ken git along without nobody&rsquo;s
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, really,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree in a pleasant
tone, &ldquo;you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> get on very well, you
know.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t get on with men beyond the
mountains&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t measure up with them in any way,
except perhaps, in the use of a gun.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
because you don&rsquo;t know the things your excellent wife is
trying to learn.&nbsp; She already knows her letters, writes her
name, and is beginning to read books.&nbsp; Of course that puts
her quite a way ahead of you, Mr. McIntosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Mr.
Rowantree still stroked his mustache with a white hand and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow no woman belonging to me to know
more than I know,&rdquo; said Mr. McIntosh in what was meant to
be a very manly manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;What knowing thar is around
our house is for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late, too late,&rdquo; cried Mr. Rowantree, waving
his hand magnificently in the air.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, she
knows more than you this very minute.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got the
key to the puzzle.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t stop her now.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got something you haven&rsquo;t&mdash;something that
puts her in line with the world beyond these
mountains&mdash;something that will comfort and amuse her as long
as she lives.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the wonder about learning; once
you get it in your head, nobody can take it away from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowantree regarded the mountaineer with an unflinching
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I ken take it out o&rsquo; her,&rdquo; said
the man, his eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Mr.
Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may think you can, but you
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got hold of a secret that makes
her more powerful than you, though of course your muscles are <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>much
stronger than hers.&nbsp; Mark this, Mr. McIntosh: No matter how
things go with her, she&rsquo;ll always have a kind of happiness
that no one can take away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause and then Mr. Rowantree went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;s getting something that
she&rsquo;ll not want to keep to herself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
way with folk who learn.&nbsp; They want to pass their knowledge
on.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be passing it to her children and
they&rsquo;ll come up in the world.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t tell
anything about <i>how</i> far they&rsquo;ll come up.&nbsp; They
may get to be the best known and most useful men and women in the
state.&nbsp; They say children take from their mother, and your
children have a good mother, Mr. McIntosh.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a
woman with a clear, sensible mind, who wants to lift herself up
out of poverty and ignorance.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the sort of a
wife you have, sir, and I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preposterously pleasant Mr. Rowantree advanced upon the
glowering McIntosh and held out his hand.&nbsp; In bewilderment
the mountaineer took it and received a grip that surprised
him.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you proud of her?&rdquo; demanded
Mr. Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what it is to be proud of a
wife, sir.&nbsp; I have one that&rsquo;s much too good for me,
and I realize it.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s a great thing for a man
to have a wife he can be proud of; one that can do something he
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ken do what she&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; said Mr.
McIntosh defiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thar ain&rsquo;t no reason that
I ken see, why I can&rsquo;t do it as well as her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree, shaking his
head, &ldquo;you might&mdash;but I doubt it, Mr.
McIntosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a young shote that I ken!&rdquo;
cried the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a brace of my ducks that you
can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Rowantree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Mr. McIntosh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me a
book.&nbsp; Set down and tell me about this here
l&rsquo;arning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowantree turned to the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brace of ducks against a young shote that Mr.
McIntosh cannot learn to read,&rdquo; he said gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are the witnesses.&nbsp; Coulter, kindly bring me a
primer from that closet.&nbsp; You will all observe that I play
fair.&nbsp; I shall do my <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>best to teach him, but I frankly
confess I have my doubts.&nbsp; He has looked down on
book-learning and that is against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McIntosh made no reply.&nbsp; He had hung his hat on a
nail and now he drew his one &ldquo;gallus&rdquo; a little
tighter as if to prepare for a struggle.&nbsp; At the opposite
corner of the room from his wife, he bent over his book.&nbsp;
Mr. Rowantree drew a chair up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will give our attention, if you please,&rdquo; he
said in his mellow voice, and in a perfectly matter-of-fact way,
&ldquo;to the first letter of the alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Mrs. McIntosh bent very low over her page and only the
children sitting next saw her shoulders shaking with
laughter.&nbsp; The children themselves, determined not to spoil
sport, kept their mirth till they should be upon the mountain
paths.&nbsp; Then they would have their chuckle there over the
way McIntosh &ldquo;was tricked into
l&rsquo;arnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now they devoted themselves to
their own lessons, and away in the backs of their minds a new
idea was growing.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t their own fathers and
mothers come to school?&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t they all know
how to read?&nbsp; It was just as Mr. Rowantree said; they
couldn&rsquo;t <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&ldquo;match up&rdquo; with the men and women beyond
the mountains.&nbsp; They were different&mdash;terribly
different.&nbsp; Oh, yes, proud as they were, these children of
the mountain clans, they knew that.&nbsp; Their sisters
weren&rsquo;t like Miss Azalea and Miss Carin&mdash;not at all
like them.&nbsp; Their fathers weren&rsquo;t like Mr. Rowantree;
and though in some ways Mr. Rowantree was not liked by them, and
his disinclination to work was noted even by these folk of
easy-going ways, still, he was different.&nbsp; He knew about the
great world beyond; about what people were doing in the cities;
he was acquainted with what other men thought and wrote, and he
could talk in a wonderful way.&nbsp; Just see how he had come it
over McIntosh, and taken the &ldquo;meanness&rdquo; out of
him!</p>
<p>It was the red-headed boy, Dibblee Sikes, the most sociable
child in the school, who put into words the thing that had been
stirring in the children&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; He came up to Mr.
Rowantree at the nooning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look as if you had,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree
cordially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I always count it a <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>pleasant
day when I have a new idea.&nbsp; What have you thought of,
Sikes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, seeing Mrs. McIntosh take up with books, sir, and
Mr. McIntosh set down to beat her out in learning, made me think
of having a school for the grown folks.&nbsp; They need it just
as much as us young-uns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly do, Sikes, and do you know, the same
notion has been in my head ever since McIntosh joined us?&nbsp;
Just look at him, will you?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s sitting over there
on the ground, studying like a good fellow.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
even stop to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he ain&rsquo;t got nothing <i>to</i> eat, seeing
he didn&rsquo;t count on staying when he come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sikes
grinned at his instructor, and Mr. Rowantree returned the smile,
accompanying it with a gentle wink of the left eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his wife offered him half of her luncheon, though
she didn&rsquo;t have much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I reckon he&rsquo;s eating with one hand and
studying with the other,&rdquo; said Dibblee blithely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how about that school, Mr. Rowantree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it would be impossible for most of them
to come in the daytime.&nbsp; They <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>have to attend to their work,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Rowantree asked the question
rather vaguely.&nbsp; It was a subject about which he was not
very well informed.</p>
<p>Dibblee nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure they do,&rdquo; he said in
the language he had picked up from some &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;
boys at Bee Tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we need here, then, is a night school.&nbsp;
Everything could be made safe in the homes, the big children
could be set to look after the little ones, and then the fathers
and mothers could come here.&nbsp; What do you think of that,
Sikes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a mighty good thing, Mr. Rowantree, but
there&rsquo;s one thing stands in the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dibblee
wore a &ldquo;studyin&rsquo;&rdquo; look which sat oddly on his
round, smiling face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, half the time it&rsquo;s darker than a
hat on the roads, with the trees growing over them and all.&nbsp;
Some folks around here ain&rsquo;t even got lanterns, and anyway,
if they had, they wouldn&rsquo;t want to go out such pitch black
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they could come on moonlight nights,&rdquo; cried
Mr. Rowantree triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>have a
moonlight school, Sikes.&nbsp; Moonlight will be a sign and token
that school has taken up.&nbsp; What do you say to
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s just the very thing,&rdquo; cried
Dibblee Sikes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then my ma can come, can&rsquo;t
she?&nbsp; Why, she&rsquo;s jest as knowing as she can
be&mdash;keeps me laughing at her purty near all the time
I&rsquo;m home.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got more rules for cooking than
anybody hereabouts, and she can remember the greatest
songs&mdash;about fifty verses long, some of them be&mdash;about
things that has happened in this here country.&nbsp; But she
carries it all in her head.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t read, jest
because she ain&rsquo;t been taught.&nbsp; If she could read
she&rsquo;d be the smartest woman anywhere, almost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowantree was a man with his own faults, but for every
fault he had a virtue, and now his eyes were alight like the
boy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Sikes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
we&rsquo;ll teach her.&nbsp; A moonlight school we shall have,
and with the permission of Miss Carson and her friend, I will
teach it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a happy man, Sikes, but I
haven&rsquo;t been a particularly useful one.&nbsp; So now
I&rsquo;ll surprise myself by turning over a new leaf.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to be useful, if teaching my neighbors what I
know is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Rowantree,&rdquo; interrupted the boy,
&ldquo;I wisht school was over so I could run home and tell my
ma.&nbsp; I know she&rsquo;ll want to come, and she&rsquo;ll make
other folks want to come, too.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be real
surprised the way my ma can get folks to do things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree;
&ldquo;not if she&rsquo;s like you, Sikes.&nbsp; You can get folk
to do things, too.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got me to take a job, and
by Jove, I didn&rsquo;t know it was in me to do such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laziest man in the community smiled at the red-headed boy,
and the boy grinned back, and in doing so revealed three
vacancies in the two rows of teeth.&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;tooth-dropping&rdquo; time with him, and he was not
beautiful.</p>
<p>The afternoon, it must be confessed, seemed rather tedious to
Mr. Rowantree.&nbsp; He wondered where Azalea and Carin had found
their patience.&nbsp; Nay, it took something more than patience
to sow the seeds of knowledge in these uncultivated minds.&nbsp;
Yet he had to admit, that though uncultivated, they were not
rocky and sterile soil.&nbsp; On the contrary, beneath all their
shyness, the children were wild to learn.&nbsp; Paralee was, of
course, not present that day, so he <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>missed the pleasure of instructing
the one pupil who treated books as if they were food and she a
starveling.</p>
<p>One last odd incident closed the day of strange experiences
for this new teacher.&nbsp; In spite of his utmost efforts, poor
Skully had broken out every once in a while with his
&ldquo;blabbing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The children, rather strained and
excited by the presence of their very learned instructor, finally
&ldquo;got the giggles&rdquo; after the fashion of tired and
nervous school children the world over.&nbsp; Even the gentle
Mrs. McIntosh could not keep from a foolish &ldquo;snicker&rdquo;
now and then as the wild cadences of Skully&rsquo;s voice broke
on the air and were choked back by a grimy hand clapped across
his mouth.&nbsp; The poor little &ldquo;blab&rdquo; boy was
covered with confusion, and finally, in despair, dropped his
towseled head upon his arm and softly wept.</p>
<p>The children, ashamed and sorry, did the very thing they did
not want to do, and giggled all the more.&nbsp; And at that, up
rose Bud Coulter, the hereditary enemy of little Skully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a-here, you-all,&rdquo; he said defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I said that there kid should come to school and no harm
should be done him.&nbsp; What I say I <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>mean.&nbsp;
Nobody but a Coulter ken take the stuffing out of a Simms, and
this here Coulter is going to see that this here Simms is give a
chanct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home, Skully, my lad,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree
kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a hard day for you, but
you&rsquo;ve done wonders.&nbsp; Practice studying to yourself
awhile this evening, and be here to-morrow morning with the
rest.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come out ahead.&nbsp; Miss Azalea was
very happy that you were to be in her school.&nbsp; You see, she
and Miss Carin have given up a good deal to come up here to help
you young folk along, and they want everybody in the country
round about to get some good out of the school.&nbsp; They want
you to make their sacrifice and hard work worth while.&nbsp; So
you&rsquo;ll come to-morrow, won&rsquo;t you, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skully lifted a tear-stained face and looked at the teacher
with weary eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, sir,&rdquo; he said sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please be so good as to run over to Miss
Azalea&rsquo;s house to see how they are getting on there, and
bring me back word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skully cast a look of gratitude at the man who was making his
escape easy, and finding his battered <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>corn husk hat, fled from the
school.</p>
<p>Incredibly soon he was back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Zalie says for you to come over to the house soon
as ever school closes, sir,&rdquo; Skully reported.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She says to tell you Mis&rsquo; Rowantree is there and Mr.
Keefe is mighty poorly, and Mis&rsquo; Rowantree wants to take
him home with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later when school closed, the teacher found Skully
sitting on a log, book in hand, studying with one finger acting
as monitor to his lips.</p>
<p>The children pretended not to notice and slipped away after
their fashion down the mountain paths.&nbsp; Mrs. McIntosh walked
with her little daughter, but while Mr. Rowantree watched, he saw
McIntosh stride forward, throw his little girl pick-a-back over
his shoulder, and lope down the trail behind his wife.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE HERMIT THRUSH</span></h2>
<p>Keefe O&rsquo;Connor had slept for hours, heavily, and Miss
Zillah, stealing in every few minutes to look at him, was not
well satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything if we had a good doctor at
hand,&rdquo; she said to the girls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rest is a fine
thing, of course, but it isn&rsquo;t always enough.&nbsp; Keefe
seems badly in need of stimulation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
his heart would have been strained like that, great as the
exertion of carrying poor Mr. Panther was, if he hadn&rsquo;t
been run down.&nbsp; Probably he hasn&rsquo;t been having half
enough to eat, for one thing.&nbsp; Cooking for himself the way
he has is a bad thing.&nbsp; We ought to have had him in here
with us oftener.&nbsp; I blame myself very much.&nbsp; But I
hesitated to act, knowing so little of him and being responsible
for you two girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In course of time Mrs. McEvoy came over, and she, too, tiptoed
into the room to look at the sleeping youth.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got medicine for almost everything
that can ail a body,&rdquo; she said when she had joined the
others on the porch, &ldquo;but the trouble is, I don&rsquo;t
know what <i>is</i> the matter with him.&nbsp; He seems clean
beat out.&nbsp; Now, if only Mrs. Rowantree was here she might be
able to give us some notion of what to do.&nbsp; She reads doctor
books so that she can care for her children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea snatched at the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do have Mrs. Rowantree come,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that Mrs. McEvoy speaks of it, I realize
that I&rsquo;ve been wanting Mary Cecily Rowantree all
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a queer girl you are, Azalea,&rdquo; smiled
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every little while you put on a mysterious
look and say something eerie, as if you had been talking with
spooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one bit spooky, Carin, and you know
it,&rdquo; said Azalea rather indignantly, &ldquo;but now and
then I do have feelings&mdash;&rdquo; she did not try to finish
her sentence, but stared before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant,&rdquo; retorted Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have feelings!&nbsp; And you look as if you
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all mysteriously moved to do certain
things,&rdquo; said the gentle Miss Zillah, who did <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>not like
her girls even to make a pretense of teasing each other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I myself would like to have Mrs. Rowantree here.&nbsp; She
knew Keefe before we did, and she is of the same nationality, and
so possibly might have some peculiar sympathy with him.&nbsp; I
also think we should send for a physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any use in sending for
physicians to come up here,&rdquo; Carin put in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just think how hard I tried to get one for Mr.
Panther.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have Mrs. Rowantree over by all
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Miles McEvoy, a much busier man these days than he had been
for years before, undertook to go for Mrs. Rowantree, though he
was only just back from carrying Haystack Thompson and Mr. and
Mrs. Panther to the station.</p>
<p>Carin decided to walk down the road a way to meet the wagon
bringing Mary Cecily Rowantree; and Miss Zillah, seeing the
prospect of another guest, went into the kitchen to stir up a
cake and compound a custard.&nbsp; But Azalea did not move.&nbsp;
She sat near the door and from time to time looked in at the
delicate face of the sleeping youth.&nbsp; It appeared almost
transparent as he lay there, his eyes closed and <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>yet not
quite closed, his lips trembling a little from the fluttering of
his over-taxed heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to
him,&rdquo; her heart cried within her.&nbsp; &ldquo;How sunny
and brave he is&mdash;and yet how sad, in that strange quiet
way.&nbsp; We know him, and yet we don&rsquo;t know him.&nbsp; If
he should die, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to send word to any of
his friends, for we haven&rsquo;t an idea who they are.&nbsp; But
of course he mustn&rsquo;t die.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no reason why
he should when he&rsquo;s so young and all.&nbsp; And
yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy opened his eyes drowsily and looked about him.&nbsp;
At first he failed to remember where he was, and half-raised
himself on his elbow.&nbsp; Then he sank back, white and
trembling.&nbsp; Azalea poured a glass of water from the jar they
kept on the window sill, and hastening to him, lifted his head
and gave him the cool drink.</p>
<p>Keefe smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good,&rdquo; he said simply.&nbsp; Then,
after a pause: &ldquo;Sit down, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea took a low mountain chair and brought it near, so that
she could face him.&nbsp; That mysterious feeling which had been
hanging over her all day, whispering to her that something <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>strange was
about to happen, deepened curiously.&nbsp; Little chills ran
lightly over her frame and she had to close her hands to keep her
fingers from twitching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must seem particularly silly to you that a fellow
can&rsquo;t do a little job like the one I did yesterday without
going to pieces over it,&rdquo; Keefe began.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever been very strong.&nbsp; I
have color in my face, and that rather fools people.&nbsp; It
fools me too, and makes me think I&rsquo;m of more account than I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a terribly hard piece of work you did
yesterday,&rdquo; replied Azalea softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But perfect
rest will make you all right, Aunt Zillah thinks.&nbsp; If I were
you, I wouldn&rsquo;t talk, boy.&nbsp; Aunt Zillah says
you&rsquo;re not to move a finger, and I&rsquo;m sure that means
you&rsquo;re not to move your tongue either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what anybody wants, Azalea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
something to tell you and I&rsquo;m going to do it
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t, Keefe, really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe lifted a languid hand, but it had authority in it.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you for a long
time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, Zalie, if I
wait&mdash;it may possibly be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Keefe, I won&rsquo;t have you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, please.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to tell you
now, quickly, before anybody comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on then.&nbsp; Speak quietly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She realized suddenly that it was kinder and wiser to let him
have his way.&nbsp; So she folded her hands in her lap, and sat
as still as a stone&mdash;no, as still as a rosebush, for the
wind rustled her pale green frock, and lifted the tendrils of her
brown hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zalie,&rdquo; he began, his voice at once uncertain yet
determined, &ldquo;I told you, didn&rsquo;t I, that I knew
neither my name nor my kin?&nbsp; I am a waif, but not because I
was not loved.&nbsp; That is what is queer and sad about it
all.&nbsp; That is what keeps me always looking and hoping that
some day&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off and rested for a
minute.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must begin at the beginning,&rdquo; he
recommenced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must tell you what I remember.&nbsp;
There was a pleasant home, somewhere, with a low window from
which I could look down the street if I stood on my toes.&nbsp;
There was a father, a mother, and a sister who played with me,
and <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>whom
I adored.&nbsp; Matey was what I called her.&nbsp; That little
name is all I have to remember her by.&nbsp; I cannot even tell
you my own last name.&nbsp; I was &lsquo;Little
Brother.&rsquo;&nbsp; When any of the three said it, I was
happy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Little Brother!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the thing
I have loved best in all the memories&mdash;the way they said
that.&nbsp; But father went away.&nbsp; There were darkened
windows, a long black box, and all the house was changed.&nbsp;
It was as terrible as if the sun had gone out of heaven.&nbsp; I
was so lonely and sad it seemed as if I would die, and I remember
always clinging to black skirts&mdash;sometimes my
mother&rsquo;s, sometimes my Matey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment longer, his dark eyes darkening yet
more, and throwing into relief the pallor of his face.&nbsp;
Azalea was still immovable, but the look of her face
changed.&nbsp; A warm, wild surmise banished something of the
anxiety in it and flushed it with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then next, I remember the ship.&nbsp; Mother and Matey
and I were on it with hundreds and hundreds of others, all
crowded together sickeningly.&nbsp; Mother was always in her bed,
and Matey and I sat together, creeping out of people&rsquo;s way,
wrapped in an old plaid shawl.&nbsp; <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>I would go to sleep beneath the
shawl; and under the shelter of it she told me stories, while the
wind flapped it against us.&nbsp; Then there came a day
when&mdash;when my mother would not answer either Matey or
myself.&nbsp; I heard Matey screaming and I screamed with her,
and some women were good to us.&nbsp; One kept kissing me, though
I didn&rsquo;t want to be kissed.&nbsp; After that, I saw no more
of mother.&nbsp; I know now they must have dropped her in the
sea, but of course they told me nothing of that.&nbsp; There were
only Matey and me crouching out of the wind beneath that old
shawl, Matey crying in my hair and on my face, and trying to
laugh and play with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the changed look on Azalea&rsquo;s face and could not
quite make it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So then, the landing day came, and sister and I were
pushed down the gangplank with the others.&nbsp; I remember
falling and losing hold of her hand, and getting up and catching
at her skirt again.&nbsp; At least I thought it was her
skirt.&nbsp; I ran down the wharf as fast as I could, holding on
to that dress.&nbsp; Then I remember some one shrieking:
&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t Jimmy at all!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s another boy
altogether!&rsquo;&nbsp; And with that a woman seized <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>me by the
arm and shook me till I screamed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who air you
that&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; the place of me Jimmy?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have forgotten all the other words of that day, but I
remember those.&nbsp; The people kept pouring and pouring along,
and I think the woman left me to look for her Jimmy.&nbsp; So
after a while I found myself in the street with the people and
the carts and carriages dashing every way about me.&nbsp; I ran
about like a crazy boy, too frightened to ask questions.&nbsp;
Finally a man who was going along with a tin pail on his arm,
stopped and picked me up.&nbsp; He tried to talk to me, but I was
too frantic to listen, and anyway, I was only a baby.&nbsp; He
took me to a poor home, a dark place with two rooms or maybe
three, and there was a woman there who was good to me.&nbsp; I
used to hear the two of them talking and saying that whoever I
belonged to couldn&rsquo;t have cared much for me or they&rsquo;d
have been looking for me.&nbsp; But afterward, I came to believe
that they were not very anxious to have my people find me.&nbsp;
They were homesick folk with no little ones, and they thought I
was one of a great brood and would not be missed.&nbsp; So I
lived with them, Azalea, till I was seven years of
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;Till you were seven!&rdquo; breathed Azalea,
leaning forward a little now.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then,
Keefe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then good Bridget O&rsquo;Connor, who had, in her
way, been a mother to me, died.&nbsp; Mike O&rsquo;Connor was
fond of me, too, but how could he be looking after me, and
himself away every day working on the street?&nbsp; Besides, said
he to me: &lsquo;You be different from us O&rsquo;Connors,
boy.&nbsp; It would be a shame to tie you down all your life to a
man like me.&nbsp; Bridget knew it, God save her, but she wanted
the sound of your voice in the house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put you
with the good Sisters, and they&rsquo;ll find a new fayther and
mother for ye.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he did.&nbsp; He put me in an
orphan asylum, and there I lived for three months, and at the end
of that time I was taken by another lonely woman who wanted a
child in her house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; breathed Azalea, &ldquo;was she good to you,
Keefe?&nbsp; You were so little&mdash;so dreadfully little!&nbsp;
Was she good to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight color had come back to Keefe&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; His
lips were no longer so blue and unnatural as they had been.&nbsp;
He put out his hand and caught a little fold of Azalea&rsquo;s
frock between his fingers and held on to it as children hold on
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>to the
dresses of the women they depend upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was good to me,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;with
a wise goodness which did not let me be spoiled.&nbsp; She was
not a married woman.&nbsp; Her name was Harriet Foster, and the
name tells what she was like, simple and straightforward and
practical.&nbsp; She had lost all of her family and was tired of
living alone.&nbsp; She had been looking for some time for a
child to help fill her life, and when she saw me, she seemed
satisfied.&nbsp; I was satisfied, too, and not at all afraid of
her even at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you rest awhile now, Keefe?&rdquo; broke in
Azalea, trying desperately to do her duty.&nbsp; Keefe looked at
the parted lips and shining eyes which betrayed her breathless
inquisitiveness, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Foster did not make me her son by legal
adoption,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;She left my name as it
was.&nbsp; Bridget had named me Keefe, which was her name before
she was married, and dear old Mike had lent me the honorable name
of O&rsquo;Connor.&nbsp; So Keefe O&rsquo;Connor I
remained.&nbsp; But instead of the foul basement home I had
known, here was a quiet, staid, respectable home; a three-storied
red brick structure, cared for by self-respecting servants,
furnished with pleasing <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>old furniture, and presided over by
Harriet Foster.&nbsp; She had a group of quiet, gracious friends
like herself, whom she entertained at tea once a week, bringing
me in to be shown off.&nbsp; I passed their teacups and sang
little songs for them sometimes, and after I had begun to draw,
was told to show them my drawings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you love her?&rdquo; broke in Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did she seem like a mother to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love her?&nbsp; I felt contented with her; but she
seldom kissed me even when I was a little fellow.&nbsp; She
taught me to be very self-reliant and thorough, and gave me a
fine discipline.&nbsp; We liked to be together.&nbsp; It was
always a great day when we went out to the sea, or to the picture
galleries.&nbsp; We could laugh together and be patient together
over troubles.&nbsp; If that is loving, then we loved each
other.&nbsp; But no, she didn&rsquo;t seem like a mother to
me.&nbsp; She seemed like Miss Foster, and that is what I called
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor little boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so poor, Azalea, not so poor.&nbsp; Children
aren&rsquo;t poor when they&rsquo;re given a chance to be
themselves and aren&rsquo;t driven from pillar to post by some
tyrant.&nbsp; Miss Foster let me grow up to be myself.&nbsp; She
fed me, clothed me, housed me, <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>and taught me her ideas of honor and
kindness and right living.&nbsp; When she found that I wanted to
be an artist, she put me in the way of becoming one.&nbsp; I
lived with her till I was seventeen years of age.&nbsp; Then she,
too, like my poor little mother and dear blowsy Bridget
O&rsquo;Connor, left me, and since then, I have been
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone!&rdquo; repeated Azalea beneath her breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And never a word of your sister all these years,
Keefe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at him so beautifully, bending forward, questioning
him as it seemed, so almost gayly, that he looked at her in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, Azalea, in all these years&mdash;not one
word.&nbsp; I used to hope and pray to meet her, but after a time
I tried to put it out of my mind.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want it to
undermine me.&nbsp; We Irish are queer folk, Azalea.&nbsp; We can
wear ourselves out with longing.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to do
that.&nbsp; Miss Foster had left me a little fortune; enough to
let me keep on with my art studies and to give me a little start
in life.&nbsp; I had to leave the comfortable old house where I
had spent such contented years, because that went to make a home
for old ladies.&nbsp; But I lived on well enough in my
attic&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t be frightened at the word.&nbsp; <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>I lived in
an attic by choice.&nbsp; Then perhaps I overworked.&nbsp; At any
rate, the doctor said I must get out of the city and live in
these mountains for two or three years.&nbsp; So here I am,
piling up canvases in Miles McEvoy&rsquo;s barn and as happy as
anyone need be, especially since I met you&mdash;you people,
Zalie.&nbsp; It may seem odd to you, but these few weeks here
with the Rowantrees and &lsquo;you-all&rsquo; at Oriole&rsquo;s
Nest, have been the happiest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it odd at all,&rdquo; cried
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Keefe, I think it the most natural thing
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked, astonished at her tone.&nbsp; But
she remembered that dragged and wearied heart of his and putting
her lips tight together, would say nothing.&nbsp; He had to take
her smiling silences for his answer.</p>
<p>Then, before he could urge her, some one stood on the doorstep
without the room.&nbsp; Azalea, seeing the shadow fall across the
floor guessed who it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you!&rdquo; she cried happily, &ldquo;you, of all
people!&nbsp; Come in, Mrs. Rowantree.&nbsp; Keefe&rsquo;s fallen
ill and Aunt Zillah said that you&rsquo;d be just the person to
know what to do for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; said Mary Cecily
in her sweet Irish voice, &ldquo;but how can we be sure of that
at all?&nbsp; Still, it&rsquo;s myself that must confess to some
experience, what with the rearing of the four children and the
being so far from a medical man.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s ailing you,
Mr. Keefe, dear?&rdquo; she asked with beautiful gentleness,
stooping over him, sister-fashion, and taking his hand in
hers.</p>
<p>And then Azalea knew beyond all doubt!&nbsp; She wondered that
she had not always known.&nbsp; Each had reminded her of the
other, and yet with a strange stupidity she had not realized it,
no doubt because it had seemed so certain that they must be
strangers whose paths never had crossed.</p>
<p>She tried to be calm, to take the scene as a matter of course,
but those two who had so longed for each other being there, so
near, so unlike in some ways, yet so like with their sad-glad
faces, made her put her hands to her eyes to hide the sight of
them.&nbsp; She almost forgot that they did not yet know.&nbsp;
She all but forgot Keefe&rsquo;s heart and his need for
quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;d sent for you, Mrs.
Rowantree, and I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve been put to the
trouble,&rdquo; Keefe was saying.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;I met Miss Carin down the road and I know what a
hero you&rsquo;ve been, lad,&rdquo; she said under her
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was beautiful&mdash;helping a man out of
his &lsquo;prison house of pain&rsquo; like that.&nbsp; Maybe
you&rsquo;ll have to pay by being laid up for a time, but I know
you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself that it&rsquo;s worth
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;If poor Panther gets
well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I hope for that&mdash;I pray for that&mdash;the
poor man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe said nothing more.&nbsp; He seemed very weary.&nbsp;
Mary Cecily sat beside him, looking down at him, and he,
half-closing his eyes, watched her changeful face.&nbsp; Azalea
had sunk on the doorstep and sat there, her heart beating so she
thought the others must hear it.&nbsp; All her thoughts and
wishes were pouring out toward them, willing them to speak.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the woodland a hermit thrush sent out its liquid,
lovely note.&nbsp; It seemed above all sounds in the world, the
one that suited the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they speak?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t they
speak?&rdquo; Azalea asked the question over and over to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;They <i>must</i> speak.&nbsp; They will <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>be so happy
when they know!&nbsp; Oh, how lonely they&rsquo;ve been.&nbsp;
Oh, poor dears!&nbsp; But <i>why</i> don&rsquo;t they
speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if the very air palpitated with her passionate
desire.</p>
<p>Then: &ldquo;I wish you were my sister, Mrs. Rowantree,&rdquo;
said the boy&rsquo;s wistful voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
been telling Miss Azalea how I once had a sister.&nbsp; Matey,
she was called.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it a sweet little name?&nbsp;
We were on a ship crossing the sea, my sister and my little
mother and myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a little bit of a boy I
was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea heard a low cry of utter happiness, of amazed, yet
undoubting faith.&nbsp; She slipped from the room and ran down
the path.&nbsp; Her tears fell as she fled, but her heart was
singing.</p>
<p>The hermit thrush kept up its deep and tender song, but Azalea
was certain that the words being spoken in that room were more
beautiful and wonderful by far.</p>
<h2><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE REBEL</span></h2>
<p>Azalea never forgot how quietly and sweetly that night came
down.&nbsp; The mountain, so old&mdash;older than the peaks of
the Rockies or the Sierras&mdash;lay beneath the stars with an
air of placidity as comforting to the spirit as great music or
great words.</p>
<p>Within the room where Keefe rested, the shadows deepened till
Azalea and the others could no longer see his long form on the
sofa, nor the little dark head of Mary Cecily bent to touch
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of finding some one on the earth who really,
really belongs to you,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Carin, how happy they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they!&rdquo; sighed Carin
sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear, Azalea, it makes me
homesick for papa and mamma.&nbsp; Yet here we are, only half
through the term of school we promised to teach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s been dull,&rdquo;
replied <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>Azalea with a fluttering little laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just think of all that has happened these short three
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Rowantree, who had supped
with them, and who sat with them now on the porch, &ldquo;to be
riding home to Constance and the other children.&nbsp; Paralee
kindly promised that she would look in on them and help them get
a bit of something to eat, but now I really must be getting
along.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve never been alone before after
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to leave Mrs. Rowantree here
then?&rdquo; asked Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s
good of you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe those two could bear to
be separated.&nbsp; I know I couldn&rsquo;t bear to have
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they must stay together,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, what a brave, bright little creature
my Mary Cecily is, Miss Pace!&nbsp; Folks think I don&rsquo;t
appreciate her because I&rsquo;m a lazy, dreamy fool who
hasn&rsquo;t found out how to take hold of life over here, but
perhaps some day I&rsquo;ll be able to show them that I&rsquo;m
not quite such a useless creature as they think me.&nbsp; I know
my faults better than anyone else knows them; and the worst fault
of them all is not being <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>properly ashamed of myself.&nbsp; I
always was too indifferent to what others thought; but since you
came, Miss Pace, with these fine unselfish girls, I&mdash;well,
I&rsquo;ve seen myself pretty much as others must see me and I
confess I don&rsquo;t like the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Rowantree,&rdquo; cried Aunt Zillah,
distressed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to say a single polite
thing, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Leave me the virtue of my
repentance.&nbsp; Now, about my little wife&rsquo;s brother in
there; he must come to Rowantree Hall to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
Miles McEvoy can drive him over the way he took Panther to the
station, lying out on the straw in the wagon box.&nbsp;
Keefe&rsquo;s a fine fellow, no manner of doubt about that.&nbsp;
I took to him from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the pictures Keefe has up in Mr.
McEvoy&rsquo;s barn?&rdquo; asked Aunt Zillah.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pleasure and profit to look at
them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure when Mr. and Mrs. Carson see them
they&rsquo;ll be all for having an exhibit of them down at
Lee.&nbsp; Many artists come there, as you know, and it&rsquo;s
the habit of the tourists to attend their exhibits.&nbsp;
Sometimes they purchase very freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a fine thing for him if something <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>of the sort
could be done,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree.&nbsp; &ldquo;My only
fear is that Mary Cecily may have another philandering male for
her to care for.&nbsp; That really would be one too many.&nbsp; I
declare,&rdquo; he added humorously, &ldquo;if it came to that, I
think it might drive me to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea could not repress a little laugh, but Carin maintained
disapproving silence.&nbsp; She liked Mr. Rowantree&mdash;nobody
could help liking him&mdash;but she certainly did not approve of
him, and it was not in her to ease off the situation as Azalea
could.&nbsp; Azalea had grown up among vagabonds, and if she
recognized in the magnificent Rowantree a new variety of the
tribe, it only made her tolerant of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>do</i> like to teach, don&rsquo;t you, Mr.
Rowantree?&rdquo; she said encouragingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Paralee
met me and told me what a wonderful day it had been for them all,
and how you came it over that poor silly Mr. McIntosh.&nbsp; If
only you had been given a chance to teach, maybe&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated, not quite seeing where her speech would lead
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I would have stirred my old stumps, eh, Miss
Azalea, and not sat around on my gallery giving a bad imitation
of a Southern <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>planter, while my lion-hearted little wife used her wit
and her strength to provide for the lot of us?&nbsp; Well, now,
maybe you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp; And that reminds me of a plan we
evolved among us to-day.&nbsp; That nice red-headed
boy&mdash;whatever his name is&mdash;helped shape the
notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told them the idea of the moonlight school and instantly
Azalea was on fire with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Rowantree,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what a
splendid thought&mdash;what a shining, glittering thought!&nbsp;
It looks just like a king, dressed in white and jewels and with a
crown on its head.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s make it come true.&nbsp;
Carin, you&rsquo;re the wonderful one for doing things.&nbsp; All
I can do is to exclaim, but you go off and do them.&nbsp; Make
this come true, Carin!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t bear to have it
stay merely a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a glorious idea,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose men and women were quite happy in the old days,
Mr. Rowantree, in ignorance.&nbsp; My father says some of the
old, unlettered peasants were very wise, and that they had
valuable knowledge they passed on from father to son.&nbsp; But
in these days it certainly does seem terrible for a man or woman
not to know how to read <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>or write, particularly here in our
country where everyone should have a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; cried Aunt Zillah, who was a
great patriot; &ldquo;in this glorious country where everyone
ought to be given a chance!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the promise
we&rsquo;ve held out to those who come to our shores, and
it&rsquo;s that which helps me to overlook so many things that
seem wrong in our dear land.&nbsp; Greedy we may be, and
disgraced by the scheming and grafting of our politicians, but
after all, it is here that the ignorant are educated and the
lowly learn to lift up their heads.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m proud to
be an American, and if I had my life to live over again I would
devote it to some cause that would help on the real
Americanism.&nbsp; Now, here&rsquo;s Azalea, God bless her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going to work among the mountaineers.&nbsp; What
could be more fitting?&nbsp; The child has just the nature for
the task, and her experiences have helped her to understand many
things that a more carefully sheltered girl could not have
understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll marry happily and keep in her own
home,&rdquo; said Mr. Rowantree shortly, while Azalea colored
scarlet and was grateful for the gloom that hid her face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old-fashioned <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>man and I like to see a woman in her
home.&nbsp; As one of the chief of Miss Azalea&rsquo;s friends I
do not desire a public career for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in the dusk Miss Zillah&rsquo;s head could be seen
shaking emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re an
old-fashioned man, Mr. Rowantree, I suppose I&rsquo;m what could
be called an old-fashioned woman.&nbsp; But this I will say: I
believe in women using their powers, and I think a woman of
intelligence and health has the ability to look after her home
and do something else besides.&nbsp; Azalea may marry or she may
not, but in any event I hope she&rsquo;ll use her influence and
some of her best thought in behalf of these poor people
&rsquo;round about us.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a great one for
foreign missions&mdash;although I&rsquo;ve no objection to
them&mdash;but I do say that life is twice as wonderful and
beautiful when one helps on her fellow beings.&nbsp; There never
was a place in the world where missionary work was needed more
than it is right here in our own beloved state of North
Carolina.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a kind and gracious old state, and as
beautiful as anything that lies beneath the sky, but it&rsquo;s
got some poor, neglected members of the human family in it, and
I&rsquo;m all for helping them on.&nbsp; I <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>love
Azalea, and have great confidence in her, and that&rsquo;s why I
want to see her give herself to a useful and important
work.&nbsp; If she wasn&rsquo;t of much account, I
shouldn&rsquo;t think that it mattered what she did; but
she&rsquo;s of much account, and so, if she were mine I would
give her to this service of her kind as I would give a son, if I
had one, to fight and die for his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Zillah&rsquo;s gentle voice had gathered to itself
unusual power, and its tones, charged with feeling, penetrated to
the shadowy room where Keefe and Mary Cecily were.&nbsp; Mary
Cecily laughed softly as she arose from the low chair where she
had been sitting, and Keefe echoed her.&nbsp; Perhaps it struck
them as amusing that anybody should find it necessary to worry
about anything now, when suddenly, to them, the world seemed so
completely right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you in there?&rdquo; queried Rowantree.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of driving home the night, Mary Cecily,
and leaving you here with Keefe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, would Mary Cecily be happy away from the little
ones?&rdquo; asked Keefe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m much
better&mdash;fifty percent better, I assure you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
not necessary for&mdash;for my sister to stay with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice caught on <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>the words.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
sister&rdquo; was not easily uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;ve no thought of leaving you, brother
dear&mdash;no thought at all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as my husband
says.&nbsp; He can ride home to the children; and very good and
dear it is of him to think of it.&nbsp; The two of us will be
along in the morning, as you were planning a while back.&nbsp; Be
off, Bryan dear.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only Paralee with the
children, and she&rsquo;s strange to them.&nbsp; Tell them all
that&rsquo;s happened to me to-day, and let Constance know that
I&rsquo;m bringing home an own uncle&mdash;the very one
she&rsquo;d have chosen, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea drew back into the shadow of the house.&nbsp; So in the
morning they would be off&mdash;Keefe and his bright little
sister&mdash;carrying their rich romance with them, and the
Oriole&rsquo;s Nest would be the poorer for their going!&nbsp;
They would be gloriously happy together, telling each other all
that had happened in the years they had been apart.&nbsp; They
would go farther, those two, with their eager, answering minds,
and would talk not only of what they had done, but of what they
had thought and felt.&nbsp; Each would be turning out the riches
of his mind for <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>the other to see&mdash;holding up their fancies as if
they were embroidered clothes, and each marveling at what the
other had to show.&nbsp; They would be telling to each other the
poetry they knew; and Keefe would be making pictures while Mary
Cecily watched.&nbsp; And how the two of them would love the
children and admire their graceful ways!&nbsp; Azalea could see
how they would look, all the family of them, sitting about the
blazing fire in that queer &ldquo;drawing-room.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Keefe&rsquo;s pictures would be put up on the wall&mdash;the
whole place would be plastered with them&mdash;and they would be
talking about this one and that, and where it was painted.&nbsp;
Then they would be singing together, and whistling and
dancing&mdash;heaven only knew what they would or wouldn&rsquo;t
do.</p>
<p>Azalea felt the hot tears of shameless envy crowding out from
under her lids, and hated herself for them.&nbsp; She to help on
her fellow-men?&nbsp; She to work to add to the goodness and
happiness of the world, when she grudged these two their simple
happiness, after so many years of tears and longing and
heartache?&nbsp; Could a more miserable, absurd, abject girl than
herself <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>be found anywhere, she wondered.&nbsp; She thanked
heaven that the friends there beside her did not dream how
ignoble she was.</p>
<p>Rowantree meantime had said good night and had mounted and
ridden away.&nbsp; They watched the light of his lantern flitting
like a firefly among the trees and at last disappearing entirely
in the night.</p>
<p>The McEvoys came with the milk, and lingered to learn the
news.&nbsp; As they walked away Miss Zillah and her girls could
hear their soft singsong voices in kindly unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re right sweet folks,&rdquo; Miss Zillah
declared, sighing unaccountably.&nbsp; &ldquo;At first they did
seem queer to me, but now I&rsquo;ve grown to be as fond of them
as if they were old neighbors.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re a good example
of a happy married pair, too.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as I ever
heard them really disagree about a thing; and though those
medicine bottles must be a terrible trial to Mr. McEvoy, he never
says a word about them, except, of course, to tease Mis&rsquo;
Cassie a little now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There haven&rsquo;t been any new bottles bought since
we came up here, I notice,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose we&rsquo;ve kept Mis&rsquo; Cassie so busy that she <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>hasn&rsquo;t had time to take thought about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a fine little plan that I&rsquo;d like to
carry into execution,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down
home I have quite a number of pretty mantel ornaments I bought
long ago when&mdash;when I thought I was going to have a little
home of my own.&nbsp; I&mdash;I never told you about that, my
dears, but it seems a good time to do it now, this being such a
wonderful day for us all.&nbsp; You see, I had my wedding clothes
made, and I was to marry one of the kindest, fairest-minded men
that ever lived in the world.&nbsp; And he&mdash;he was killed,
dears&mdash;thrown from his horse and killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea had still kept in the background, those hurt and lonely
tears hot beneath her lids; and now, at the story of
another&rsquo;s sorrow, she frankly let them fall.&nbsp;
Curiously, though, they were not so hot and bitter as she had
thought they would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Zillah,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;we never
guessed!&nbsp; Yet we might have known.&nbsp; There always was
something about you so gentle and sweet&mdash;we might have known
that you&rsquo;d had sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few live to my age without having sorrow, Zalie, but my
sorrow came in my youth, and it <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>took the zest out of life for a
time.&nbsp; However, it was a sweet sorrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
always been able to keep my lover young and kind in my
memory.&nbsp; But what I started to say was, that I put away and
never have used the things I got for that little home I meant to
have.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m going to write sister Adnah and ask
her to send me my mantel ornaments.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re very
pretty and chaste,&rdquo; went on Miss Zillah quaintly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Little shepherds and shepherdesses, piping to each other,
and all dressed in the softest pink and blue, and a clock to
match.&nbsp; I even have an embroidered cover for the mantel,
done in cross stitch and in pastel colors to go with the
ornaments.&nbsp; If I give these to Mis&rsquo; Cassie and induce
her to put them in the spare room she&rsquo;ll stick the medicine
bottles away out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll go in that mess under the house,&rdquo;
agreed Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it will be a grand day for the
McEvoys when they do.&nbsp; Oh, Aunt Zillah, how tired and sleepy
I am&mdash;almost too tired and sleepy to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel just the same way,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yet I hate to leave the night to itself, it&rsquo;s so
lovely.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll sleep days and keep
awake nights, I love the night so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah with the voice of
authority, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be talking nonsense.&nbsp; We will
get to our beds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they slipped in softly behind the great chimney and the
pretty screens to their own quaint makeshift of bedroom, leaving
Mary Cecily on a cot near her brother.&nbsp; The windows and
doors all stood open to the night, and the girls could hear the
soft rustlings of the wood and the tinkle of the brook.&nbsp; The
whippoorwills were very distant and their insistent cry sounded
sweet and mournful, though it could be hectoring enough when it
was near at hand.&nbsp; But nothing was hectoring this night,
except that foolish, wistful longing in Azalea&rsquo;s restless
young heart, because Keefe and Mary Cecily were so happy in
themselves, and because it was taken for granted that she,
Azalea, was always to be so brave and so eager for service, and
was to be a missionary to the mountain folk and was never to have
any joy of her own&mdash;no real, selfish, glorious joy!&nbsp;
Yet only the other day she had told Carin how clearly the finger
of fate pointed to her as one set apart to &ldquo;do
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; She would never marry, she had
said&mdash;never, never&mdash;because she could not marry a
&ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; and <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>because she would marry no one who
could not lay claim to that name.&nbsp; And they had taken her at
her word&mdash;or at least, they had almost done so.&nbsp; She
was to be Azalea McBirney, the adopted daughter of the mountain
folk, the little sister to all the unfortunates, and was to live
apart and be good!</p>
<p>Azalea lay quite on the edge of her bed, very straight and
rigid, and looked up at the stars through her open window.&nbsp;
They were cold, unsympathetic looking stars!&nbsp; Azalea had not
previously noticed how very haughty and remote they could appear,
or how indifferent they could be to the woes and doubts, the
frets and flurries of one self-centered young person called
Azalea McBirney&mdash;one reneging, horrid young person, who was
secretly going back on all her declarations of faith and service,
and wanting nothing in the world so much as merely to be
happy!</p>
<p>Life, decided Azalea, was a puzzle.&nbsp; Once it had seemed
simple.&nbsp; Some things had plainly been right to do; others,
as plainly wrong.&nbsp; In those days she had believed she had
only, at any time, to listen to her conscience to find out
precisely what she ought to do, and therefore what <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>she wanted
to do.&nbsp; Because, of course, she wanted to do what was
right.</p>
<p>Now she was finding out that there were all sorts of matters
which were neither right nor wrong, about which she had to
decide.&nbsp; At present she was tormented with a longing to
share in the joy and in the lives of Keefe and Mary Cecily.&nbsp;
Something in them called to her.&nbsp; Their quick gayety, their
sudden sadnesses, their caring about pictures and poetry more
than they did about food or work, or sleep, or any usual, dutiful
thing, made them seem the very kin of her soul.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t account for it.&nbsp; It was merely a fact.&nbsp;
She began to understand that there might have been something of
the sort in her own poor little mother.&nbsp; When she took to
wandering the roads with a cheap &ldquo;show&rdquo; perhaps it
was not merely necessity, but some half-formed dream of wildness
and gayety and art that had led her on.&nbsp; She too had loved
the night and laughter and dancing, singing and pictures.&nbsp;
Not anything evil&mdash;Oh, no, on the contrary, only happily,
brightly good things, things that lightened the heart and set the
brain moving so that glittering little thoughts shone in it like
stars in the night.</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>The
Carsons, gentle and kind, formal and polite, were Azalea&rsquo;s
tried and trusted friends; the McBirneys, generous and loving,
lived in the inner chamber of her heart; Annie Laurie was a
gallant girl and her own true friend; but the soft gay laughter
of Keefe and Mary Cecily was as fairy bells in her ears, and that
night she could hear nothing else, it seemed&mdash;not even the
voices of the dear old friends&mdash;for the tinkling of
them.</p>
<p>So, very stiff, very straight, very miserable, she lay upon
her edge of the bed and counted the hours.&nbsp; Carin, soft as a
kitten, curled down well in the center of the mattress and slept
as babies sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come over me?&rdquo; demanded Azalea of
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I any heart?&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t I any sense?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I see anybody else
happy without being jealous of them?&nbsp; Am I an Everlasting
Pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haughty and remote stars do not answer questions like
that.&nbsp; Along in the latter part of the night Azalea fell
asleep with the question hanging in the fast-chilling air.&nbsp;
When she awoke, the day was already bright, and outside the door
sounded the voice of Miles McEvoy <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>making arrangements to carry Mary
Cecily and Keefe to Rowantree Hall.</p>
<p>Azalea sprang out of bed with decision.&nbsp; Her lips were
set in a hard little line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Carin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we mustn&rsquo;t
be late to school.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s settle down now for a long
hard pull.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll teach school as we never did
before.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only three weeks more ahead of us and
we mustn&rsquo;t waste a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness,&rdquo; yawned Carin, prettily, &ldquo;you
sound like a call to arms.&nbsp; All right, comrade, I&rsquo;m
with you.&nbsp; Shall we wear our pink ginghams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter what we wear?&rdquo; demanded
Azalea sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to <i>teach
school</i>.&nbsp; Nobody cares how we look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Carin sat up in bed bristling with protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come over you, Zalie?&rdquo; she
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course the children care how we
look.&nbsp; Looking as well as we can is part of our work.&nbsp;
You know you&rsquo;ve often said so yourself.&nbsp; But, dear me,
why should I worry about you, you old Zalie thing?&nbsp; You
always look lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her friends thought so that morning, certainly.&nbsp; <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>Her eyes
were a touch too bright, perhaps, her cheeks a shade too red, and
there was something a little too vivid and throbbing about
her.&nbsp; Try as hard as she could to keep in the background,
she could not succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a flaming Azalea this morning, my
dear,&rdquo; whispered Mary Cecily just before she took her seat
beside her brother in McEvoy&rsquo;s wagon for the rough journey
to Rowantree Hall.&nbsp; Keefe was white and spent-looking, but a
glorious happiness shone in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is to worry about me,&rdquo; were his words at
parting with his friends at the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s sick I am, it must be with gratitude and
bliss.&nbsp; Never will I forget your goodness to me at this
house; and now here I am, going&mdash;home!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned swimming eyes on his sister.</p>
<p>As they drove off he raised himself on one elbow&mdash;he was
reclining on the clean straw in the wagon box&mdash;to catch one
last glimpse of &ldquo;the flaming Azalea.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she
was out of sight&mdash;absurdly and irritatingly out of
sight.&nbsp; There were only Miss Zillah and the golden-headed
Carin to wave good-bye.</p>
<h2><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEW HOPES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Only two more little days,&rdquo; said Azalea,
&ldquo;and then we are through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little days, little days,&rdquo; sang Carin in a tune
of her own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only two more little days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You use strange expressions,&rdquo; remarked Miss
Zillah to her girls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;little
days&rsquo;?&nbsp; Why not &lsquo;short days&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I love anything,&rdquo; explained Azalea, &ldquo;I
call it little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do love these days?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
glad.&nbsp; I was afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Zillah, dear&mdash;afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid you were tired, my girl.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
tanned, of course, and so not pale, but you do seem rather
weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m tired, but school teachers have a perfect
right to be tired.&nbsp; Six weeks of teaching children who
haven&rsquo;t been in the habit of learning <i>is</i> rather an
order, now, isn&rsquo;t it, Aunt Zillah?&nbsp; <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>But
they&rsquo;ve <i>learned</i>!&nbsp; All this last week
they&rsquo;ve studied like mad trying to get as much as they
could before school closed.&nbsp; Even that queer, cross Mr.
McIntosh has worked as if his life depended on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His young shote depended on it, you remember,&rdquo;
laughed Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Rowantree has lost his wager with
him and will have to hand over the brace of ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the worse for Mary Cecily and the
babies,&rdquo; sighed Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll
have plenty this year, anyway.&nbsp; The farm is really doing
well, and it will do better next year now that Jake Panther is to
take it over to work it on shares.&nbsp; He has <i>much</i> more
in him than I thought at first.&nbsp; Now that he sees
there&rsquo;s some hope ahead for the Panthers, he&rsquo;s a
changed fellow.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s roofed the cabin he and his
grandmother live in, and set up a doorstep, and put out a rain
barrel and made all sorts of improvements.&nbsp; Even Grandma
Panther herself doesn&rsquo;t look quite such a witch as she
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Paralee is the prize,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Since the great news came from Asheville that her father
would soon be as strong and active as ever he was, and since dear
Aunt Zillah fitted <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>her out in decent clothes, and Jake got his regular
job, she walks and looks like one who has just discovered what it
is to be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will all come right about her going to the
Industrial School at Hardinge.&nbsp; You wrote to your father and
mother about it, Carin, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did, Zalie.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the third
time you&rsquo;ve asked me that question.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just as
sure father will send her away to school as I am that he&rsquo;ll
open up the moonlight school and put Mr. Rowantree at the head of
it.&nbsp; Oh, I do wish those dear people of mine would
come!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s so much I want to show them and tell
them about.&nbsp; We must take them over to Rowantree Hall the
very first thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a large package waiting for me at Bee
Tree,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little Dibblee Sikes
stopped in to tell me.&nbsp; It must be my mantel
ornaments.&nbsp; I want to see them on Mis&rsquo; Cassie&rsquo;s
spare room shelf before we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Carin we must be off,&rdquo; cried Azalea,
snatching her parasol from its hook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye, Aunt
Zillah.&nbsp; Only two more little days&mdash;little
days&mdash;little days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly one!&rdquo; cried Carin, gathering up her <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>parasol
also and trailing after her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why is your heart so
thistledownish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&nbsp; How do I know?&rdquo; answered
Azalea, still lilting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except because I like my
little days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had come to that, simply.&nbsp; She liked her little days
of hard work.&nbsp; She had broken the back of rebellion that
memorable day when Keefe rode away to his great happiness with
his sister, and she had been left, bereft of these two
&ldquo;charmers of the world&rdquo; as she called them, to do her
hard stint of work.&nbsp; In a way, Carin followed where she
led.&nbsp; If Azalea&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the teaching had
faltered, Carin&rsquo;s would have faltered too.&nbsp; But
Azalea&rsquo;s devotion to her work had steadily increased since
she had fought her fight with envy and selfishness.&nbsp; She had
been able to summon to her aid the hidden powers of her will, and
these had sustained her even through these last hot,
nerve-wearying days of her teaching.&nbsp; Now she felt herself
to be the victor over that indolent, brooding, indulgent self
which had more than once in her life tried to get the upper
hand.</p>
<p>Not a pupil in the school but had made headway.&nbsp; Some of
them had done extraordinarily <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>well.&nbsp; Dibblee Sikes had cried
whenever the last day of school was mentioned; but he cheered up
when Azalea assured him that there should be a &ldquo;moonlight
school&rdquo; for his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;it can be arranged so
that there will be a day school all winter long for you
youngsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not be here, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Dibblee.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one can learn us like you and Miss
Carin.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been teachers here that just yelled at
us and we got so skeered we couldn&rsquo;t learn
nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; All the fun we had was running away from
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t have that kind of a teacher, I
promise,&rdquo; Azalea assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Dibblee, if
only I knew enough I&rsquo;d stay right here and teach you all
the time; but, you see, I have to go to school myself for a long
time yet.&nbsp; As I am now, I should soon run out of learning
and you would get ahead of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed gayly and
Dibblee laughed with her.&nbsp; There was much laughter about the
schoolhouse these days, and it was no longer because some one had
blundered or met with an accident.&nbsp; They laughed now because
they were happy, because their shyness had ceased to be a torment
to them, <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>and because they felt that they were more like other
children&mdash;not strange, not some one who needed a
&ldquo;missionary&rdquo; to help them on.&nbsp; Of all the
services that Azalea and Carin had been able to perform for them,
the bestowing upon them of self-esteem was the greatest.&nbsp;
Just how this result had been attained it would be hard to
say.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the gentleness, the unfailing
politeness of their young teachers and their way of seeming as
&ldquo;kin&rdquo; to these shy, wild, suspicious young creatures,
that had done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like teaching squirrels to eat from the
hand,&rdquo; Azalea had said more than once to Carin.</p>
<p>Little had been seen of the Rowantrees and nothing of Keefe
since the day Keefe went to his sister&rsquo;s home, but they
were all, even the children, coming to school for the &ldquo;last
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The parents of the pupils were coming too, not
only that they might, like parents the world over, swell with
pride over the accomplishments of their offspring, but also
because word had been sent broadcast that the moonlight school
would be under discussion.</p>
<p>There were few flowers left on the mountain side by this time,
but the prettiest imaginable decorations had been contrived with
spurge and <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>galax, rhododendron leaves and vines.&nbsp; The place
was really a bower, and the children were clean and fresh for the
occasion.&nbsp; Indeed, it may well be doubted if certain of them
had ever been so freshened and decorated as on this day.&nbsp;
Their young teachers had led them to believe that they were to
expect high festival, and they themselves were in the most
charming of their white frocks, with the little strings of gold
beads which Mrs. Carson had given them at Christmas.</p>
<p>The event held one throbbing secret.&nbsp; It was a cold
secret, although it arose from a warm impulse.&nbsp; By the
greatest perseverance, Aunt Zillah had managed to get a wagonload
of ice and a number of ice cream freezers up from Lee, and now,
with the eager aid of the McEvoys, delicious ice cream, made
after Miss Zillah&rsquo;s own receipt, smooth as satin and
tempting as nectar, filled the great freezers which bulked
mysteriously beneath their gunny sack wrappings in the shade of
the schoolhouse.&nbsp; Moreover, in the little cupboard where
Azalea and Carin kept their stores, were six of the most noble,
decorative and triumphant cakes which Miss Zillah ever had
concocted.</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about educating the
young,&rdquo; she told the girls and Mis&rsquo; Cassie,
&ldquo;but when it comes to feeding them, I understand the matter
perfectly.&nbsp; Anyone who has reared a girl like Annie Laurie
is bound to know something about that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sighed a
little, for the day held one drawback.&nbsp; She did long to have
her niece share in the pleasures of this closing time and to have
her see what had been accomplished, and she had written begging
Annie Laurie to come, but the girl had replied vaguely.&nbsp;
Business at the dairy was very brisk.&nbsp; She was working early
and late to get her hand in completely before her valuable
assistant, Sam Disbrow, left for Rutherford Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a month yet before he goes,&rdquo; Aunt
Zillah had said almost petulantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should have
thought Annie Laurie might have spared us one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carson were already at Lee, having run down to
open up the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be no end of things to do,&rdquo; Mr.
Carson wrote his daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you really think you
need us up there, kitten?&nbsp; What difference will a few hours
make?&nbsp; Have <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>McEvoy pack up your possessions, and hasten to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mean a word of it,&rdquo; Carin
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;He and mother are simply dying to get up
here and see what we&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; Whenever papa sounds
dull and prosy like that I know he&rsquo;s planning something
delightful.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t normal for him to be
stupid.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s up to something, you&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the &ldquo;last day,&rdquo; hot, with gay clouds, came,
and the pupils appeared an hour too early, and the
Rowantree&rsquo;s old surrey swung from the thick shade of the
old wood road, all indicating that the hour was at hand, Carin
began to have her doubts.&nbsp; For once in the history of the
world, her parents were going to be stupid and sensible and
economical!&nbsp; They were going to act like other people!&nbsp;
She was horribly disappointed in them, and kept very busy so as
not to be alone with Azalea and let her see how disappointed she
was.</p>
<p>There really was a great deal to do, for the parents of the
pupils required much polite consideration.&nbsp; School did not
call that morning until half after ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The
time preceding <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>that was spent in talking about the moonlight
school.&nbsp; There seemed to be a general desire for it,
although some of the neighbors were exceedingly shy about
expressing their desires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to teach it,&rdquo; Mr. Rowantree
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do it for the smallest sum
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain folk may or may not have approved of Mr.
Rowantree, but there was none who doubted his ability to teach
them anything they might wish to know.&nbsp; Indeed, they always
had held a great opinion of his bookishness; and now they seemed
to find him more likable than they had imagined possible.&nbsp;
His fine and gracious manners never relaxed, no matter with whom
he talked, and where they had once been offended and annoyed by
this display of elegance, it now seemed different to them, since
the young teachers, who evidently approved of him, had themselves
such pretty, fine ways, and yet were so simple and friendly.</p>
<p>The truth was, the folk of Sunset Gap were beginning to take a
new view of various matters.&nbsp; For almost the first time in
their existence they had been brought into close contact with
people from the outer world, and their fears and <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>prejudices
had, in the light of their summer&rsquo;s experience, been dying
a rapid and painless death.</p>
<p>The morning hours were given up to a hasty review of the work
done, that the parents might see something of what their children
had been learning.&nbsp; The young teachers secretly hoped that
their audience would be so pleased that they would take measures
to establish a school of their own volition.</p>
<p>Now Azalea and now Carin, flushed, eager and slightly
tremulous, led on their classes through the review of reading,
spelling, geography, history and arithmetic, while crowded about
the windows and the platform sat the parents, their tanned faces
smiling and interested.&nbsp; Miss Zillah in her lavender lawn,
her curls fresh as flowers, beamed upon them from the
platform.&nbsp; Little Mary Cecily Rowantree and her brood was at
the rear, where her young ones could ease their feelings by
turning somersaults in the school doorway or by chasing an
alarmed bunny.</p>
<p>Mr. Rowantree moved about from place to place, lending an
academic aspect to the scene.&nbsp; Seated on the low, broad
window sill, gay and <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>lithe as a faun, was Keefe, with
whom Azalea and Carin had been able to exchange little more than
a nod.&nbsp; He still showed the effects of his illness, his eyes
looked unnaturally large and his mouth was strangely sensitive;
but he was more charming than ever.&nbsp; He had a sketching pad
and pencil with him, and in the most engaging manner he sketched
the heads of those in the room.&nbsp; He seemed very far away to
Azalea&mdash;very much a creature of some brighter, lighter world
than that in which she dwelt.&nbsp; She felt in her heart that he
was going on to things of which she would know nothing&mdash;to a
successful life in some great city.&nbsp; He would know artists
and the most interesting sort of folks.&nbsp; He would live in
strange, delightful places; he would travel.&nbsp; She and Sunset
Gap would be only a fading, picturesque thought in his
memory.</p>
<p>But all that foolish fretting and fuming, she told herself
severely, was over and done with.&nbsp; She was Azalea McBirney,
with her chosen work to do.&nbsp; Things were as they were; not
dreams, not charming visions, but just plain facts, plain needs,
plain work.&nbsp; Moreover, life was all the better for being as
it was.&nbsp; If the body needed simple bread more than candies,
so <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>the
spirit needed the plain bread of life more than delicacies.</p>
<p>So she bent brain, spirit, eyes, hands, lips to the labor of
the day.&nbsp; She determined to draw from each of her pupils a
quick and eager response.&nbsp; She threw herself into the
hour&rsquo;s performance, and had the profound satisfaction of
feeling those minds which a few weeks before had been so aloof,
so chilled, so closed, open to her influence as flowers open to
the sun.</p>
<p>From time to time more neighbors came and clustered about the
windows without, leaning on the sills and listening to the
program.&nbsp; Neither Azalea nor Carin paid much attention to
these soft comings and goings, these quiet unobtrusive movements
of the people without there in the heat of the changing
day.&nbsp; There was some fear of rain; Azalea heard the people
whispering about it; she herself noted how the light in the room
changed from bright sunlight to soft shadow.&nbsp; She hoped, of
course, that the rain would hold off; and yet she couldn&rsquo;t
help thinking how charming Keefe would look there on the window
ledge, with the silver rain falling between him and the trees;
and she remembered that first wonderful day at the Rowantrees, <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>when they
all had eaten on the gallery with the rain making a silver
curtain between them and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It was time for the nooning&mdash;the famous nooning that was
to hold Aunt Zillah&rsquo;s surprise&mdash;and Azalea was just
bringing the exercises to an end, when she saw an extraordinary
sight.&nbsp; Carin, the proper, the correct, the ladylike, who
had been seated on the platform near an open window, was suddenly
seen to plunge through the window like the most madcap child in
the whole school.&nbsp; Not a sound came from her, but with her
bright hair tumbling about her from the violence of her leap to
the ground, she was speeding down the path.&nbsp; What was worse
and more astonishing, Aunt Zillah, the very mirror of what was
decorous, had looked, and was now speeding after her, only she
was swung down from the window by the sympathetic Keefe, who
apparently had the key to her extraordinary conduct.&nbsp; In
spite of the titter of delight that shook the school, Azalea
preserved her dignity, but out of the corner of her eye she saw
Mr. and Mrs. Carson, and Carin homing to them like a swift dove;
<a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>and
Annie Laurie running with outstretched arms to meet her Aunt
Zillah.</p>
<p>Azalea didn&rsquo;t say even in her inmost heart: &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s nobody for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was through with
that sort of &ldquo;grumping&rdquo; and did not mean ever to give
way to it again.&nbsp; Besides, in a day or two she would be
driving up the dear familiar road with Pa McBirney, and coming
upon the well-loved clearing with the little house that was her
home, and listening to Jim&rsquo;s questions, and feeling Ma
McBirney&rsquo;s kind eyes on her, and then she would go creeping
up to her own sweet, odd room in the loft that looked up the
mountain side, and she would be happy.&nbsp; Yes, of course she
would be happy.&nbsp; That was her life.&nbsp; Every one had his
own life.&nbsp; Mary Cecily had hers and Keefe had his, and Carin
had hers&mdash;</p>
<p>All of this time she was talking, was neatly and cheerfully
bringing the exercises to a close, and her well-trained pupils
were doing their best to give her their attention and not to let
their eyes wander down the road to view the interesting scenes
taking place there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Pace,&rdquo; said Azalea clearly, &ldquo;has a
luncheon prepared for you which you are all <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>asked to
help prepare in the grove.&nbsp; Everyone is
invited&mdash;everyone.&nbsp; No one is to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had the slightest intention of going away.&nbsp; What
was the use of doing that when already Paralee and Mis&rsquo;
Cassie and Mis&rsquo; Sikes and others of the neighbors who had
been pressed into service, were bringing forth platters of
sandwiches and cold meat loaf and pickles and salad; and Miles
McEvoy was starting a fire among the well-blackened stones of a
rude fireplace in the schoolyard, and Mrs. McIntosh was mixing
coffee in the huge pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Azalea to herself, &ldquo;it is
the moment for me to go and meet my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked out of the schoolroom door quite properly, meaning
to remember every step of the way that she was only the
schoolteacher, and not Carin with loving parents, nor Aunt Zillah
with a devoted niece&mdash;but just at her most dignified and
self-conscious moment she was caught about the waist by Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s strong arms and lifted entirely off her
feet.&nbsp; Yes, right there before her pupils and all the people
she had been hoping to impress with her discretion, was swung
quite clear of the ground and <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>hugged till she literally heard a
little crack in her ribs!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you thought I wasn&rsquo;t coming up here to
see how things were going on, didn&rsquo;t you, you funny little
old schoolma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; demanded Annie Laurie&rsquo;s
strong bright tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me&mdash;as inquisitive as a
house cat&mdash;not to come nosing!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s too
ridiculous.&nbsp; Well, here I am, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she very much was, tall and glowing and quite grown up in
her pretty blue linen, with her wide hat with the
cornflowers.&nbsp; And here were Mr. and Mrs. Carson, ready to
greet Azalea as if she were almost their own.&nbsp; Oh, it was
good to have Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s arm about her waist&mdash;good
to be in the encircling gentleness and protection of her calm
love!</p>
<p>But there really wasn&rsquo;t a moment to waste in talk.&nbsp;
Azalea told them that.&nbsp; Her mind swung back to its
duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After luncheon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin remembered her responsibilities, too; and Aunt Zillah
was suddenly in a hospitable flurry.&nbsp; But there really was
no call for haste.&nbsp; Sunset Gap was not used to it.&nbsp;
There always had been, in the experience of its inhabitants, <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>plenty of
time for everything.&nbsp; There was time to eat,
certainly.&nbsp; People sat about in little groups and partook of
Aunt Zillah&rsquo;s delicious repast, and they waited on each
other graciously, forgetting, it seemed, all about their shyness
and their terrific pride and their old quarrels.</p>
<p>But the great moment came when the generous freezers yielded
up their strange confection, and for the first time in their
lives the folk at Sunset Gap knew the taste of that odd little
miracle among foods, ice cream in August weather.&nbsp; Some
tasted it suspiciously; some ate it injudiciously; some knew it
for a good thing from the first second; some doubted till they
had sampled the second saucer; but all realized that this would
be an occasion to tell of; and that if the truth of the
statements were doubted, they had witnesses to prove that they
had eaten frozen food the hottest day of the year.</p>
<p>That afternoon came the &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; and like last
day exercises in schools the world over, what they involved of
anguish, triumph, amusement and disaster it would take long to
relate, and the record would be of no interest save to those who
had suffered and rejoiced with the day&rsquo;s events.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>They
were shortened&mdash;fortunately, no doubt&mdash;by the approach
of the storm which had threatened all day.&nbsp; The watchers
without grew restless; the horses stamped and tugged at their
hitching, and Azalea, bringing the session quickly and happily to
an end, begged for one second&rsquo;s hearing for Mr. Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has something very important to say to you,&rdquo;
she cried, her voice reaching out above the heads of her restive
audience.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must listen, because it is something
that may make all your future lives happier.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
smiled at them beautifully, and they paused, half risen from
their seats to listen.</p>
<p>Charles Carson had but a brief word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moonlight school of which you have been talking,
friends, will be opened here next month.&nbsp; It will hold every
night that the moon shines the year round for the next twelve
months.&nbsp; Each person who enters has the privilege of paying
what he can for his instruction.&nbsp; If he cannot pay, he shall
have the instruction nevertheless.&nbsp; Mr. Rowantree, your
neighbor, a scholarly man and one whom many a university would be
proud to have on its list of teachers, will be your leader.&nbsp;
May it be for your great <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>good and joy!&nbsp; I believe it
will be, for no joy in this world is greater than the joy of
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Mr. Carson,&rdquo; cried Keefe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come now!&nbsp;
<i>Whoop&mdash;whoop&mdash;hurrah</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbors and the children gave the cheer heartily if
somewhat awkwardly, and when Keefe called &ldquo;Three cheers for
your teachers, Miss Carson and Miss McBirney,&rdquo; they became
rather lustier; and when he came to, &ldquo;Three cheers for Miss
Pace,&rdquo; remembering the dainties she had provided, they were
aroused to a hoarse enthusiasm.&nbsp; They wanted to be polite;
to shake hands; to say thank you; but the storm was
muttering.&nbsp; Azalea waved them all away laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why say good-bye?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never forget you and you&rsquo;ll never forget
us, but we mustn&rsquo;t stop to talk about it.&nbsp; The
storm&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; Run&mdash;or stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thunder drowned her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Azalea,&rdquo; cried Keefe; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
stop to lock up.&nbsp; Some of the people will be wanting to stay
in the schoolhouse, probably.&nbsp; Here, put on my coat and
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t run, Keefe,&rdquo; warned
Azalea.&nbsp; <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;Your heart&mdash;mustn&rsquo;t you be careful of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy laughed lightly and held out his hand, and Azalea,
taking it, felt herself flying along through the darkening paths
of the woods.</p>
<p>Safe in the Oriole&rsquo;s Nest, the Carsons, the Rowantrees,
the Paces and Keefe and Azalea, made many plans that evening of
wild summer rain.&nbsp; It had been arranged that they were all
to be accommodated for the night between the McEvoys&rsquo; and
the cottage, so since none was leaving, there was no need for
haste.&nbsp; Not a person there was of the sort who feels that
nightfall bids him to bed.&nbsp; They did as they pleased with
their day and their night, and this night they wished to
talk.&nbsp; The little Rowantrees, Gerald and the weary
Constance, Moira and Michael, the twins, were nested in the
hammocks and on the couches, and in the lightning-pierced gloom,
with the storm crashing and thundering about them, the others sat
long, talking over each other&rsquo;s affairs with a frankness
which might not have been easy under other circumstances.</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>Keefe
made it known that he was going to New York, taking his
summer&rsquo;s product of pictures with him, to &ldquo;try
himself out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had something to work for now; there
was some zest to life; he wanted to make a success of himself for
the sake of Mary Cecily and the children.&nbsp; Annie Laurie was
to attend to her dairy, and being now ready to take up advanced
studies, was to study the University Extension Course by
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parkhurst, your governess,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carson
to Carin, &ldquo;is not coming back, my dear.&nbsp; She is to
live nearer her mother and sister and teach school.&nbsp; That
means that our plans for you must be changed.&nbsp; We shall send
you to the Roanoke Academy for Young Ladies.&nbsp; After you have
had two years there you may take up your study of painting, if
you wish to do so, in some art school.&nbsp; In the meantime, you
will have art instruction at the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; cried Carin, &ldquo;that
means&mdash;why, that means that Azalea and Annie Laurie and I
will not study together any more.&nbsp; Why, it means breaking up
the Triple Alliance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never worry about changes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carson in
her silvery voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the changes that <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>make life
interesting.&nbsp; Good has always come to you, Carin, and good
will continue to come.&nbsp; Annie Laurie has already chosen what
she wishes to do.&nbsp; We have decided what we think best for
you.&nbsp; There remains only Azalea to care for.&nbsp; How is it
with you, Azalea?&nbsp; What do you wish to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Azalea, her heart trembling a
little in spite of her efforts to be calm and philosophic,
&ldquo;to prepare myself to take charge of the mountain
industries at Lee.&nbsp; Just how I can best fit myself for this
work I do not know.&nbsp; I mustn&rsquo;t desert Mother McBirney,
must I?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t put any expense on my dear family,
but I can stay at home and learn weaving of Mother McBirney and
basket-making of dear old Haystack Thompson, and go to Jug Town
and find out how to make pottery.&nbsp; I can pick up my
education, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat tall, slight and very girlish-looking, by the table on
which rested the reading lamp.&nbsp; Her vivid face, thrown into
relief by the soft glow, had, to all those present, a sweet and
gracious familiarity.&nbsp; They loved her, wanted her with them,
wanted her to help them make up the sum of good things that is
called &ldquo;home.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>There was not one person there who
wanted to spare her, yet here she was with her little declaration
of independence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up to New York,&rdquo; whispered Keefe,
fascinated, &ldquo;and study at the School of Design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make my own way,&rdquo; she said
valiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&mdash;it would make me happier than
anything else.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather not be sent anywhere.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d rather cut my own path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So proud,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Carson whimsically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Would it hurt you to accept help from those who love you,
Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it pride?&rdquo; asked Azalea with a bright
thoughtfulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t think
it is.&nbsp; I want to use my own will, Mr. Carson, to see what I
can spin out of myself.&nbsp; If it should happen to be a
wonderful silver web how pleased I would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so young, Azalea, dear,&rdquo; mourned
Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to taking too much
risk.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be too independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t, Azalea,&rdquo; pleaded Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let papa and mamma make some plan for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They understand me better than you do, Carin
love,&rdquo; said her friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;They know what <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>a joy it is
to make one&rsquo;s own plans and carry them out.&nbsp; Annie
Laurie knows, too, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie nodded her fine ruddy head.&nbsp; She knew.&nbsp;
Keefe knew too, for he was like an eagle in his love of
freedom.&nbsp; They all gave way before Azalea finally.&nbsp; She
was no longer a little girl to be petted and given presents to,
and to be consoled for her orphanage by the hospitality they
could offer.&nbsp; She was a young woman, poor, united to humble
people, gifted with a strange, fine talent&mdash;a talent for
living and for making things seem rich and wonderful&mdash;and it
was their business to let her have her way.&nbsp; She had grown
up during the summer.&nbsp; She realized it herself, and knew as
the rest of them could not, what the influences had been which
had brought that transformation to pass.&nbsp; Henceforth, she
would have her own way to make, her own sorrows to endure, her
own peculiar joys to seek.&nbsp; Until now one hand after another
had guided her; she had clung to skirts, so to speak.&nbsp; But
she had grown past that; she must walk alone.</p>
<p>She looked about her at the rude but charming room, and at the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
